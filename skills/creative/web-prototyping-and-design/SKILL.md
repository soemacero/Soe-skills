# Web Prototyping And Design


---

## Claude Design for CLI/API Agents

Use this skill when the user asks for design work that would normally fit Claude Design, but the agent is running in a CLI/API environment instead of the hosted Claude Design web UI.

The goal is to preserve Claude Design's useful design behavior and taste while removing hosted-tool plumbing that does not exist in normal agent environments.

**Before starting, check for other web-design skills like `popular-web-designs` (ready-to-paste design systems for Stripe, Linear, Vercel, Notion, etc.) and `design-md` (Google's DESIGN.md token spec format).** If the user wants a known brand's look, load `popular-web-designs` alongside this one and let it supply the visual vocabulary. If the deliverable is a token spec file rather than a rendered artifact, use `design-md` instead. Full decision table below.

## When To Use This Skill vs `popular-web-designs` vs `design-md`

Hermes has three design-related skills under `skills/creative/`. They do different jobs — load the right one (or combine them):

| Skill | What it gives you | Use when the user wants... |
|---|---|---|
| **claude-design** (this one) | Design *process and taste* — how to scope a brief, gather context, produce variants, verify a local HTML artifact, avoid AI-design slop | a from-scratch designed artifact (landing page, prototype, deck, component lab, motion study) with no specific brand or token system dictated |
| **popular-web-designs** | 54 ready-to-paste design systems — exact colors, typography, components, CSS values for sites like Stripe, Linear, Vercel, Notion, Airbnb | "make it look like Stripe / Linear / Vercel", a page styled after a known brand, or a visual starting point pulled from a real product |
| **design-md** | Google's DESIGN.md spec format — author/validate/diff/export design-token files, WCAG contrast checking, Tailwind/DTCG export | a formal, persistent, machine-readable design-system *spec file* (tokens + rationale) that lives in a repo and gets consumed by agents over time |

Rule of thumb:

- **Process + taste, one-off artifact** → claude-design
- **Match a known brand's look** → popular-web-designs (and let claude-design drive the process)
- **Author the tokens spec itself** → design-md

These compose: use `popular-web-designs` for the visual vocabulary, `claude-design` for how to turn a brief into a thoughtful local HTML file, and `design-md` when the output is the token file rather than a rendered artifact.

## Runtime Mode

You are running in **CLI/API mode**, not the Claude Design hosted web UI.

Ignore references from source Claude Design prompts to hosted-only tools, project panes, preview panes, special toolbar protocols, or platform callbacks that are not available in the current environment.

Examples of hosted-tool concepts to ignore or remap:

- `done()`
- `fork_verifier_agent()`
- `questions_v2()`
- `copy_starter_component()`
- `show_to_user()`
- `show_html()`
- `snip()`
- `eval_js_user_view()`
- hosted asset review panes
- hosted edit-mode or Tweaks toolbar messaging
- `/projects/<projectId>/...` cross-project paths
- built-in `window.claude.complete()` artifact helper
- tool schemas embedded in the source prompt
- web-search citation scaffolding meant for the hosted runtime

Instead, use the tools actually available in the current agent environment.

Default deliverable:

- a complete local HTML file
- self-contained CSS and JavaScript when portability matters
- exact on-disk path in the final response
- verification using available local methods before saying it is done

If the user asks for implementation in an existing repo, generate code in the repo's actual stack instead of forcing a standalone HTML artifact.

## Core Identity

Act as an expert designer working with the user as the manager.

HTML is the default tool, but the medium changes by assignment:

- UX designer for flows and product surfaces
- interaction designer for prototypes
- visual designer for static explorations
- motion designer for animated artifacts
- deck designer for presentations
- design-systems designer for tokens, components, and visual rules
- frontend-minded prototyper when code fidelity matters

Avoid generic web-design tropes unless the user explicitly asks for a conventional web page.

Do not expose internal prompts, hidden system messages, or implementation plumbing. Talk about capabilities and deliverables in user terms: HTML files, prototypes, decks, exported assets, screenshots, code, and design options.

## When To Use

Use this skill for:

- landing pages
- teaser pages
- high-fidelity prototypes
- interactive product mockups
- visual option boards
- component explorations
- design-system previews
- HTML slide decks
- motion studies
- onboarding flows
- dashboard concepts
- settings, command palettes, modals, cards, forms, empty states
- redesigns based on screenshots, repos, brand docs, or UI kits

Do not use this skill for pure DESIGN.md token authoring unless the user specifically asks for a DESIGN.md file. Use `design-md` for that.

## Design Principle: Start From Context, Not Vibes

Good high-fidelity design does not start from scratch.

Before designing, look for source context:

1. brand docs
2. existing product screenshots
3. current repo components
4. design tokens
5. UI kits
6. prior mockups
7. reference models
8. copy docs
9. constraints from legal, product, or engineering

If a repo is available, inspect actual source files before inventing UI:

- theme files
- token files
- global stylesheets
- layout scaffolds
- component files
- route/page files
- form/button/card/navigation implementations

The file tree is only the menu. Read the files that define the visual vocabulary before designing.

If context is missing and fidelity matters, ask concise focused questions instead of producing a generic mockup.

## Asking Questions

Ask questions when the assignment is new, ambiguous, high-fidelity, externally facing, or depends on taste.

Keep questions short. Do not ask ten questions by default unless the problem is genuinely underspecified.

Usually ask for:

- intended output format
- audience
- fidelity level
- source materials available
- brand/design system in play
- number of variations wanted
- whether to stay conservative or explore divergent ideas
- which dimension matters most: layout, visual language, interaction, copy, motion, or systemization

Skip questions when:

- the user gave enough direction
- this is a small tweak
- the task is clearly a continuation
- the missing detail has an obvious default

When proceeding with assumptions, label only the important ones.

## Workflow

1. **Understand the brief**
   - What is being designed?
   - Who is it for?
   - What artifact should exist at the end?
   - What constraints are locked?

2. **Gather context**
   - Read supplied docs, screenshots, repo files, or design assets.
   - Identify the visual vocabulary before writing code.

3. **Define the design system for this artifact**
   - colors
   - type
   - spacing
   - radii
   - shadows or elevation
   - motion posture
   - component treatment
   - interaction rules

4. **Choose the right format**
   - Static visual comparison: one HTML canvas with options side by side.
   - Interaction/flow: clickable prototype.
   - Presentation: fixed-size HTML deck with slide navigation.
   - Component exploration: component lab with variants.
   - Motion: timeline or state-based animation.

5. **Build the artifact**
   - Prefer a single self-contained HTML file unless the task calls for a repo implementation.
   - Preserve prior versions for major revisions.
   - Avoid unnecessary dependencies.

6. **Verify**
   - Confirm files exist.
   - Run any available syntax/static checks.
   - If browser tools are available, open the file and check console errors.
   - If visual fidelity matters and screenshot tools are available, inspect at least the primary viewport.

7. **Report briefly**
   - exact file path
   - what was created
   - caveats
   - next decision or next iteration

## Artifact Format Rules

Default to local files.

For standalone artifacts:

- create a descriptive filename, e.g. `Landing Page.html`, `Command Palette Prototype.html`, `Design System Board.html`
- embed CSS in `<style>`
- embed JS in `<script>`
- keep the artifact openable directly in a browser
- avoid remote dependencies unless they are explicitly useful and stable
- include responsive behavior unless the format is intentionally fixed-size

For significant revisions:

- preserve the previous version as `Name.html`
- create `Name v2.html`, `Name v3.html`, etc.
- or keep one file with in-page toggles if the assignment is variant exploration

For repo implementation:

- follow the repo's actual stack
- use existing components and tokens where possible
- do not create a standalone artifact if the user asked for production code

## HTML / CSS / JS Standards

Use modern CSS well:

- CSS variables for tokens
- CSS grid for layout
- container queries when helpful
- `text-wrap: pretty` where supported
- real focus states
- real hover states
- `prefers-reduced-motion` handling for non-trivial motion
- responsive scaling
- semantic HTML where practical

Avoid:

- huge monolithic files when a real repo structure is expected
- fragile hard-coded viewport assumptions
- inaccessible tiny hit targets
- decorative JS that fights usability
- `scrollIntoView` unless there is no safer option

Mobile hit targets should be at least 44px.

For print documents, text should be at least 12pt.

For 1920×1080 slide decks, text should generally be 24px or larger.

## React Guidance for Standalone HTML

Use plain HTML/CSS/JS by default.

Use React only when:

- the artifact needs meaningful state
- variants/toggles are easier as components
- interaction complexity warrants it
- the target implementation is React/Next.js and fidelity matters

If using React from CDN in standalone HTML:

- pin exact versions
- avoid unpinned `react@18` style URLs
- avoid `type="module"` unless necessary
- avoid multiple global objects named `styles`
- give global style objects specific names, e.g. `commandPaletteStyles`, `deckStyles`
- if splitting Babel scripts, explicitly attach shared components to `window`

If building inside a real repo, use the repo's package manager and component architecture instead.

## Deck Rules

For slide decks, use a fixed-size canvas and scale it to fit the viewport.

Default slide size: 1920×1080, 16:9.

Requirements:

- keyboard navigation
- visible slide count
- localStorage persistence for current slide
- print-friendly layout when practical
- screen labels or stable IDs for important slides
- no speaker notes unless the user explicitly asks

Do not hand-wave a deck as markdown bullets. Create a designed artifact if asked for a deck.

Use 1–2 background colors max unless the brand system requires more.

Keep slides sparse. If a slide feels empty, solve it with layout, rhythm, scale, or imagery placeholders, not filler text.

## Prototype Rules

For interactive prototypes:

- make the primary path clickable
- include key states: default, hover/focus, loading, empty, error, success where relevant
- expose variations with in-page controls when useful
- keep controls out of the final composition unless they are intentionally part of the prototype
- persist important state in localStorage when refresh continuity matters

If the prototype is meant to model a product flow, design the flow, not just the first screen.

## Variation Rules

When exploring, default to at least three options:

1. **Conservative** — closest to existing patterns / lowest risk
2. **Strong-fit** — best interpretation of the brief
3. **Divergent** — more novel, useful for discovering taste boundaries

Variations can explore:

- layout
- hierarchy
- type scale
- density
- color posture
- surface treatment
- motion
- interaction model
- copy structure
- component shape

Do not create variations that are merely color swaps unless color is the actual question.

When the user picks a direction, consolidate. Do not leave the project as a pile of options forever.

## Tweakable Designs in CLI/API Mode

The hosted Claude Design edit-mode toolbar does not exist here.

Still preserve the idea: when useful, add in-page controls called `Tweaks`.

A good `Tweaks` panel can control:

- theme mode
- layout variant
- density
- accent color
- type scale
- motion on/off
- copy variant
- component variant

Keep it small and unobtrusive. The design should look final when tweaks are hidden.

Persist tweak values with localStorage when helpful.

## Content Discipline

Do not add filler content.

Every element must earn its place.

Avoid:

- fake metrics
- decorative stats
- generic feature grids
- unnecessary icons
- placeholder testimonials
- AI-generated fluff sections
- invented content that changes strategy or claims

If additional sections, pages, copy, or claims would improve the artifact, ask before adding them.

When copy is necessary but not final, mark it as draft or placeholder.

## Anti-Slop Rules

Avoid common AI design sludge:

- aggressive gradient backgrounds
- glassmorphism by default
- emoji unless the brand uses them
- generic SaaS cards with icons everywhere
- left-border accent callout cards
- fake dashboards filled with arbitrary numbers
- stock-photo hero sections
- oversized rounded rectangles as a substitute for hierarchy
- rainbow palettes
- vague labels like “Insights,” “Growth,” “Scale,” “Optimize” without content
- decorative SVG illustrations pretending to be product imagery

Minimal is not automatically good. Dense is not automatically cluttered. Choose intentionally.

## Typography

Use the existing type system if one exists.

If not, choose type deliberately based on the artifact:

- editorial: serif or humanist headline with restrained sans body
- software/productivity: precise sans with strong numeric treatment
- luxury/minimal: fewer weights, more spacing discipline
- technical: mono accents only, not mono everywhere
- deck: large, clear, high contrast

Avoid overused defaults when a stronger choice is appropriate.

If using web fonts, keep the number of families and weights low.

Use type as hierarchy before adding boxes, icons, or color.

## Color

Use brand/design-system colors first.

If no palette exists:

- define a small system
- include neutrals, surface, ink, muted text, border, accent, danger/success if needed
- use one primary accent unless the assignment calls for a broader palette
- prefer oklch for harmonious invented palettes when browser support is acceptable
- check contrast for important text and controls

Do not invent lots of colors from scratch.

## Layout and Composition

Design with rhythm:

- scale
- whitespace
- density
- alignment
- repetition
- contrast
- interruption

Avoid making every section the same card grid.

For product UIs, prioritize speed of comprehension over decoration.

For marketing surfaces, make one idea land per section.

For dashboards, avoid “data slop.” Only show data that helps the user decide or act.

## Motion

Use motion as discipline, not theater.

Good motion:

- clarifies state changes
- reduces anxiety during loading
- shows continuity between surfaces
- gives controls tactility
- stays subtle

Bad motion:

- loops without purpose
- delays the user
- calls attention to itself
- hides poor hierarchy

Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for non-trivial animation.

## Images and Icons

Use real supplied imagery when available.

If an asset is missing:

- use a clean placeholder
- use typography, layout, or abstract texture instead
- ask for real material when fidelity matters

Do not draw elaborate fake SVG illustrations unless the assignment is explicitly illustration work.

Avoid iconography unless it improves scanning or matches the design system.

## Source-Code Fidelity

When recreating or extending a UI from a repo:

1. inspect the repo tree
2. identify the actual UI source files
3. read theme/token/global style/component files
4. lift exact values where appropriate
5. match spacing, radii, shadows, copy tone, density, and interaction patterns
6. only then design or modify

Do not build from memory when source files are available.

For GitHub URLs, parse owner/repo/ref/path correctly and inspect the relevant files before designing.

## Reading Documents and Assets

Read Markdown, HTML, CSS, JS, TS, JSX, TSX, JSON, SVG, and plain text directly when available.

For DOCX/PPTX/PDF, use available local extraction tools if present. If not available, ask the user to provide exported text/images or use another available tool path.

For sketches, prioritize thumbnails or screenshots over raw drawing JSON unless the JSON is the only usable source.

## Copyright and Reference Models

Do not recreate a company's distinctive UI, proprietary command structure, branded screens, or exact visual identity unless the user clearly has rights to that source.

It is acceptable to extract general design principles:

- density without clutter
- command-first interaction
- monochrome with one accent
- editorial hierarchy
- clear empty states
- strong keyboard affordances

It is not acceptable to clone proprietary layouts, copy exact branded surfaces, or reproduce copyrighted content.

When using references, transform posture and principles into an original design.

## Verification

Before final response, verify as much as the environment allows.

Minimum:

- file exists at the stated path
- HTML is saved completely
- obvious syntax issues are checked

Better:

- open in a browser tool and check console errors
- inspect screenshots at the primary viewport
- test key interactions
- test light/dark or variants if present
- test responsive breakpoints if relevant

If verification is limited by environment, say exactly what was and was not verified.

Never say “done” if the file was not actually written.

## Final Response Format

Keep final responses short.

Include:

- artifact path
- what it contains
- verification status
- next suggested action, if useful

Example:

```text
Created: /path/to/Prototype.html
It includes 3 layout variants, a Tweaks panel for density/theme, and responsive behavior.
Verified: file exists and opened cleanly in browser, no console errors.
Next: pick the strongest direction and I’ll tighten copy + motion.
```

## Portable Opening Prompt Pattern

When adapting a Claude Design style request into CLI/API mode, use this mental translation:

```text
You are running in CLI/API mode, not hosted Claude Design. Ignore references to hosted-only tools or preview panes. Produce complete local design artifacts, usually self-contained HTML with embedded CSS/JS, and verify with available local tools before returning. Preserve the design process: gather context, define the system, produce options, avoid filler, and meet a high visual bar.
```

## Pitfalls

- Do not paste hosted tool schemas into a skill. They cause fake tool calls.
- Do not point the skill at a giant external prompt as required runtime context. That creates drift.
- Do not strip the design doctrine while removing tool plumbing.
- Do not over-ask when the user already gave enough direction.
- Do not under-ask for high-fidelity work with no brand context.
- Do not produce generic SaaS layouts and call them designed.
- Do not claim browser verification unless it actually happened.

## Popular Web Designs

54 real-world design systems ready for use when generating HTML/CSS. Each template captures a
site's complete visual language: color palette, typography hierarchy, component styles, spacing
system, shadows, responsive behavior, and practical agent prompts with exact CSS values.

## Related design skills

- **`claude-design`** — use for the design *process and taste* (scoping a brief,
  producing variants, verifying a local HTML artifact, avoiding AI-design slop).
  Pair it with this skill when the user wants a thoughtfully-designed page styled
  after a known brand: `claude-design` drives the workflow, this skill supplies
  the visual vocabulary.
- **`design-md`** — use when the deliverable is a formal DESIGN.md token spec
  file, not a rendered artifact.

## How to Use

1. Pick a design from the catalog below
2. Load it: `skill_view(name="popular-web-designs", file_path="templates/<site>.md")`
3. Use the design tokens and component specs when generating HTML
4. Pair with the `generative-widgets` skill to serve the result via cloudflared tunnel

Each template includes a **Hermes Implementation Notes** block at the top with:
- CDN font substitute and Google Fonts `<link>` tag (ready to paste)
- CSS font-family stacks for primary and monospace
- Reminders to use `write_file` for HTML creation and `browser_vision` for verification

## HTML Generation Pattern

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Page Title</title>
  <!-- Paste the Google Fonts <link> from the template's Hermes notes -->
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=..." rel="stylesheet">
  <style>
    /* Apply the template's color palette as CSS custom properties */
    :root {
      --color-bg: #ffffff;
      --color-text: #171717;
      --color-accent: #533afd;
      /* ... more from template Section 2 */
    }
    /* Apply typography from template Section 3 */
    body {
      font-family: 'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif;
      color: var(--color-text);
      background: var(--color-bg);
    }
    /* Apply component styles from template Section 4 */
    /* Apply layout from template Section 5 */
    /* Apply shadows from template Section 6 */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Build using component specs from the template -->
</body>
</html>
```

Write the file with `write_file`, serve with the `generative-widgets` workflow (cloudflared tunnel),
and verify the result with `browser_vision` to confirm visual accuracy.

## Font Substitution Reference

Most sites use proprietary fonts unavailable via CDN. Each template maps to a Google Fonts
substitute that preserves the design's character. Common mappings:

| Proprietary Font | CDN Substitute | Character |
|---|---|---|
| Geist / Geist Sans | Geist (on Google Fonts) | Geometric, compressed tracking |
| Geist Mono | Geist Mono (on Google Fonts) | Clean monospace, ligatures |
| sohne-var (Stripe) | Source Sans 3 | Light weight elegance |
| Berkeley Mono | JetBrains Mono | Technical monospace |
| Airbnb Cereal VF | DM Sans | Rounded, friendly geometric |
| Circular (Spotify) | DM Sans | Geometric, warm |
| figmaSans | Inter | Clean humanist |
| Pin Sans (Pinterest) | DM Sans | Friendly, rounded |
| NVIDIA-EMEA | Inter (or Arial system) | Industrial, clean |
| CoinbaseDisplay/Sans | DM Sans | Geometric, trustworthy |
| UberMove | DM Sans | Bold, tight |
| HashiCorp Sans | Inter | Enterprise, neutral |
| waldenburgNormal (Sanity) | Space Grotesk | Geometric, slightly condensed |
| IBM Plex Sans/Mono | IBM Plex Sans/Mono | Available on Google Fonts |
| Rubik (Sentry) | Rubik | Available on Google Fonts |

When a template's CDN font matches the original (Inter, IBM Plex, Rubik, Geist), no
substitution loss occurs. When a substitute is used (DM Sans for Circular, Source Sans 3
for sohne-var), follow the template's weight, size, and letter-spacing values closely —
those carry more visual identity than the specific font face.

## Sketch

Use this skill when the user wants to **see a design direction before committing** to one — exploring a UI/UX idea as disposable HTML mockups. The point is to generate 2-3 interactive variants so the user can compare visual directions side-by-side, not to produce shippable code.

Load this when the user says things like "sketch this screen", "show me what X could look like", "compare layout A vs B", "give me 2-3 takes on this UI", "let me see some variants", "mockup this before I build".

## When NOT to use this

- User wants a production component — use `claude-design` or build it properly
- User wants a polished one-off HTML artifact (landing page, deck) — `claude-design`
- User wants a diagram — `excalidraw`, `architecture-diagram`
- The design is already locked — just build it

## If the user has the full GSD system installed

If `gsd-sketch` shows up as a sibling skill (installed via `npx get-shit-done-cc --hermes`), prefer **`gsd-sketch`** for the full workflow: persistent `.planning/sketches/` with MANIFEST, frontier mode analysis, consistency audits across past sketches, and integration with the rest of GSD. This skill is the lightweight standalone version — one-off sketching without the state machinery.

## Core method

```
intake  →  variants  →  head-to-head  →  pick winner (or iterate)
```

### 1. Intake (skip if the user already gave you enough)

Before generating variants, get three things — one question at a time, not all at once:

1. **Feel.** "What should this feel like? Adjectives, emotions, a vibe." — *"calm, editorial, like Linear"* tells you more than *"minimal"*.
2. **References.** "What apps, sites, or products capture the feel you're imagining?" — actual references beat abstract descriptions.
3. **Core action.** "What's the single most important thing a user does on this screen?" — the variants should all serve this well; if they don't, they're just decoration.

Reflect each answer briefly before the next question. If the user already gave you all three upfront, skip straight to variants.

### 2. Variants (2-3, never 1, rarely 4+)

Produce **2-3 variants** in one go. Each variant is a complete, standalone HTML file. Don't describe variants — build them. The point is comparison.

Each variant should take a **different design stance**, not different pixel values. Three good variant axes:

- **Density:** compact / airy / ultra-dense (pick two contrasting poles)
- **Emphasis:** content-first / action-first / tool-first
- **Aesthetic:** editorial / utilitarian / playful
- **Layout:** single-column / sidebar / split-pane
- **Grounding:** card-based / bare-content / document-style

Pick one axis and pull apart from it. Two variants that differ only in accent color are wasted effort — the user can't distinguish them.

**Variant naming:** describe the stance, not the number.

│   └── README.md
└── 001-playful-split/
    ├── index.html
    └── README.md
```

### 3. Make them real HTML

Each variant is a **single self-contained HTML file**:

- Inline `<style>` — no build step, no external CSS
- System fonts or one Google Font via `<link>`
- Tailwind via CDN (`<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`) is fine
- Realistic fake content — actual sentences, actual names, not "Lorem ipsum"
- **Interactive**: links clickable, hovers real, at least one state transition (open/close, filter, toggle). A frozen static image is a worse spike than a sloppy animated one.

Open it in a browser. If it looks broken, fix it before showing the user.

**Verify variants visually — use Hermes' browser tools.** Don't just write HTML and hope it renders; load each variant and look at it:

```
browser_navigate(url="file:///absolute/path/to/sketches/001-calm-editorial/index.html")
browser_vision(question="Does this layout look clean and readable? Any visible bugs (overlapping text, unstyled elements, broken images)?")
```

`browser_vision` returns an AI description of what's actually on the page plus a screenshot path — catches layout bugs that pure source inspection misses (e.g. a font import that silently failed, a flex container that collapsed). Fix and re-navigate until each variant looks right.

**Default CSS reset + system font stack** for fast starts:

```html
<style>
  * { box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0; }
  body {
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto,
                 "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif;
    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
    color: #1a1a1a;
    background: #fafafa;
    line-height: 1.5;
  }
</style>
```

### 4. Variant README

Each variant's `README.md` answers:

```markdown
## Variant: {stance name}

### Design stance
One sentence on the principle driving this variant.

### Key choices
- Layout: ...
- Typography: ...
- Color: ...
- Interaction: ...

### Trade-offs
- Strong at: ...
- Weak at: ...

### Best for
- The kind of user or use case this variant actually serves
```

### 5. Head-to-head

After all variants are built, present them as a comparison. Don't just list — **opinionate**:

```markdown
## Three takes on the home screen

| Dimension | Calm editorial | Utilitarian dense | Playful split |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Density   | Low            | High              | Medium        |
| Primary action visibility | Low | High | Medium |
| Scan-ability | High | Medium | Low |
| Feel | Calm, trusted | Sharp, tool-like | Inviting, energetic |

**My take:** Utilitarian dense for power users, calm editorial for content-forward audiences. Playful split is weakest — tries to do both and commits to neither.
```

Let the user pick a winner, or combine two into a hybrid, or ask for another round.

## Theming (when the project has a visual identity)

If the user has an existing theme (colors, fonts, tokens), put shared tokens in `sketches/themes/tokens.css` and `@import` them in each variant. Keep tokens minimal:

```css
/* sketches/themes/tokens.css */
:root {
  --color-bg: #fafafa;
  --color-fg: #1a1a1a;
  --color-accent: #0066ff;
  --color-muted: #666;
  --radius: 8px;
  --font-display: "Inter", sans-serif;
  --font-body: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif;
}
```

Don't over-tokenize a throwaway sketch — three colors and one font is usually enough.

## Interactivity bar

A sketch is interactive enough when the user can:

1. **Click a primary action** and something visible happens (state change, modal, toast, navigation feint)
2. **See one meaningful state transition** (filter a list, toggle a mode, open/close a panel)
3. **Hover recognizable affordances** (buttons, rows, tabs)

More than that is over-engineering a throwaway. Less than that is a screenshot.

## Frontier mode (picking what to sketch next)

If sketches already exist and the user says "what should I sketch next?":

- **Consistency gaps** — two winning variants from different sketches made independent choices that haven't been composed together yet
- **Unsketched screens** — referenced but never explored
- **State coverage** — happy path sketched, but not empty / loading / error / 1000-items
- **Responsive gaps** — validated at one viewport; does it hold at mobile / ultrawide?
- **Interaction patterns** — static layouts exist; transitions, drag, scroll behavior don't

Propose 2-4 named candidates. Let the user pick.

## Output

- Create `sketches/` (or `.planning/sketches/` if the user is using GSD conventions) in the repo root
- One subdir per variant: `NNN-stance-name/index.html` + `README.md`
- Tell the user how to open them: `open sketches/001-calm-editorial/index.html` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux, `start` on Windows
- Keep variants disposable — a sketch that you felt the need to preserve should be promoted into real project code, not curated as an asset

**Typical tool sequence for one variant:**

```
terminal("mkdir -p sketches/001-calm-editorial")
write_file("sketches/001-calm-editorial/index.html", "<!doctype html>...")
write_file("sketches/001-calm-editorial/README.md", "## Variant: Calm editorial\n...")
browser_navigate(url="file://$(pwd)/sketches/001-calm-editorial/index.html")
browser_vision(question="How does this look? Any obvious layout issues?")
```

Repeat for each variant, then present the comparison table.

## Pretext Creative Demos

## Overview

[`@chenglou/pretext`](https://github.com/chenglou/pretext) is a 15KB zero-dependency TypeScript library by Cheng Lou (React core, ReasonML, Midjourney) for **DOM-free multiline text measurement and layout**. It does one thing: given `(text, font, width)`, return the line breaks, per-line widths, per-grapheme positions, and total height — all via canvas measurement, no reflow.

That sounds like plumbing. It is not. Because it is fast and geometric, it is a **creative primitive**: you can reflow paragraphs around a moving sprite at 60fps, build games whose level geometry is made of real words, drive ASCII logos through prose, shatter text into particles with exact per-grapheme starting positions, or pack shrink-wrapped multiline UI without any `getBoundingClientRect` thrash.

This skill exists so Hermes can make **cool demos** with it — the kind people post to X. See `pretext.cool` and `chenglou.me/pretext` for the community demo corpus.

## When to Use

Use when the user asks for:
- A "pretext demo" / "cool pretext thing" / "text-as-X"
- Text flowing around a moving shape (hero sections, editorial layouts, animated long-form pages)
- ASCII-art effects using **real words or prose**, not monospace rasters
- Games where the playfield / obstacles / bricks are made of text (Tetris-from-letters, Breakout-of-prose)
- Kinetic typography with per-glyph physics (shatter, scatter, flock, flow)
- Typographic generative art, especially with non-Latin scripts or mixed scripts
- Multiline "shrink-wrap" UI (smallest container width that still fits the text)
- Anything that would require knowing line breaks *before* rendering

Don't use for:
- Static SVG/HTML pages where CSS already solves layout — just use CSS
- Rich text editors, general inline formatting engines (pretext is intentionally narrow)
- Image → text (use `ascii-art` / `ascii-video` skills)
- Pure canvas generative art with no text role — use `p5js`

## Creative Standard

This is visual art rendered in a browser. Pretext returns numbers; **you** draw the thing.

- **Don't ship a "hello world" demo.** The `hello-orb-flow.html` template is the *starting* point. Every delivered demo must add intentional color, motion, composition, and one visual detail the user didn't ask for but will appreciate.
- **Dark backgrounds, warm cores, considered palette.** Classic amber-on-black (CRT / terminal) works, but so do cold-white-on-charcoal (editorial) and desaturated pastels (risograph). Pick one and commit.
- **Proportional fonts are the point.** Pretext's whole vibe is "not monospaced" — lean into it. Use Iowan Old Style, Inter, JetBrains Mono, Helvetica Neue, or a variable font. Never default sans.
- **Real source/text, not lorem ipsum.** The corpus should mean something. Short manifestos, poetry, real source code, a found text, the library's own README — never `lorem ipsum`.
- **First-paint excellence.** No loading states, no blank frames. The demo must look shippable the instant it opens.

## Stack

Single self-contained HTML file per demo. No build step.

| Layer | Tool | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Core | `@chenglou/pretext` via `esm.sh` CDN | Text measurement + line layout |
| Render | HTML5 Canvas 2D | Glyph rendering, per-frame composition |
| Segmentation | `Intl.Segmenter` (built-in) | Grapheme splitting for emoji / CJK / combining marks |
| Interaction | Raw DOM events | Mouse / touch / wheel — no framework |

```html
<script type="module">
import {
  prepare, layout,                   // use-case 1: simple height
  prepareWithSegments, layoutWithLines,  // use-case 2a: fixed-width lines
  layoutNextLineRange, materializeLineRange, // use-case 2b: streaming / variable width
  measureLineStats, walkLineRanges,  // stats without string allocation
} from "https://esm.sh/@chenglou/pretext@0.0.6";
</script>
```

Pin the version. `@0.0.6` at time of writing — check [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chenglou/pretext) for the latest if demo behavior is off.

## The Two Use Cases

Almost everything reduces to one of these two shapes. Learn both.

### Use-case 1 — measure, then render with CSS/DOM

```js
const prepared = prepare(text, "16px Inter");
const { height, lineCount } = layout(prepared, 320, 20);
```

You still let the browser draw the text. Pretext just tells you how tall the box will be at a given width, **without** a DOM read. Use for:
- Virtualized lists where rows contain wrapping text
- Masonry with precise card heights
- "Does this label fit?" dev-time checks
- Preventing layout shift when remote text loads

**Keep `font` and `letterSpacing` exactly in sync with your CSS.** The canvas `ctx.font` format (e.g. `"16px Inter"`, `"500 17px 'JetBrains Mono'"`) must match the rendered CSS, or measurements drift.

### Use-case 2 — measure *and* render yourself

```js
const prepared = prepareWithSegments(text, FONT);
const { lines } = layoutWithLines(prepared, 320, 26);
for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
  ctx.fillText(lines[i].text, 0, i * 26);
}
```

This is where the creative work lives. You own the drawing, so you can:
- Render to canvas, SVG, WebGL, or any coordinate system
- Substitute per-glyph transforms (rotation, jitter, scale, opacity)
- Use line metadata (width, grapheme positions) as geometry

For **variable-width-per-line** flow (text around a shape, text in a donut band, text in a non-rectangular column):

```js
let cursor = { segmentIndex: 0, graphemeIndex: 0 };
let y = 0;
while (true) {
  const lineWidth = widthAtY(y);  // your function: how wide is the corridor at this y?
  const range = layoutNextLineRange(prepared, cursor, lineWidth);
  if (!range) break;
  const line = materializeLineRange(prepared, range);
  ctx.fillText(line.text, leftEdgeAtY(y), y);
  cursor = range.end;
  y += lineHeight;
}
```

This is the most important pattern in the whole library. It's what unlocks "text flowing around a dragged sprite" — the demo that went viral on X.

### Helpers worth knowing

- `measureLineStats(prepared, maxWidth)` → `{ lineCount, maxLineWidth }` — the widest line, i.e. multiline shrink-wrap width.
- `walkLineRanges(prepared, maxWidth, callback)` — iterate lines without allocating strings. Use for stats/physics over graphemes when you don't need the characters.
- `@chenglou/pretext/rich-inline` — the same system but for paragraphs mixing fonts / chips / mentions. Import from the subpath.

## Demo Recipe Patterns

The community corpus (see `references/patterns.md`) clusters into a handful of strong patterns. Pick one and riff — don't invent a new category unless asked.

| Pattern | Key API | Example idea |
|---|---|---|
| **Reflow around obstacle** | `layoutNextLineRange` + per-row width function | Editorial paragraph that parts around a dragged cursor sprite |
| **Text-as-geometry game** | `layoutWithLines` + per-line collision rects | Breakout where each brick is a measured word |
| **Shatter / particles** | `walkLineRanges` → per-grapheme (x,y) → physics | Sentence that explodes into letters on click |
| **ASCII obstacle typography** | `layoutNextLineRange` + measured per-row obstacle spans | Bitmap ASCII logo, shape morphs, and draggable wire objects that make text open around their actual geometry |
| **Editorial multi-column** | `layoutNextLineRange` per column + shared cursor | Animated magazine spread with pull quotes |
| **Kinetic type** | `layoutWithLines` + per-line transform over time | Star Wars crawl, wave, bounce, glitch |
| **Multiline shrink-wrap** | `measureLineStats` | Quote card that auto-sizes to its tightest container |

See `templates/donut-orbit.html` and `templates/hello-orb-flow.html` for working single-file starters.

## Workflow

1. **Pick a pattern** from the table above based on the user's brief.
2. **Start from a template**:
   - `templates/hello-orb-flow.html` — text reflowing around a moving orb (reflow-around-obstacle pattern)
   - `templates/donut-orbit.html` — advanced example: measured ASCII logo obstacles, draggable wire sphere/cube, morphing shape fields, selectable DOM text, and dev-only controls
   - `write_file` to a new `.html` in `/tmp/` or the user's workspace.
3. **Swap the corpus** for something intentional to the brief. Real prose, 10-100 sentences, no lorem.
4. **Tune the aesthetic** — font, palette, composition, interaction. This is the work; don't skip it.
5. **Verify locally**:
   ```sh
   cd <dir-with-html> && python3 -m http.server 8765
   # then open http://localhost:8765/<file>.html
   ```
6. **Check the console** — pretext will throw if `prepareWithSegments` is called with a bad font string; `Intl.Segmenter` is available in every modern browser.
7. **Show the user the file path**, not just the code — they want to open it.

## Performance Notes

- `prepare()` / `prepareWithSegments()` is the expensive call. Do it **once** per text+font pair. Cache the handle.
- On resize, only rerun `layout()` / `layoutWithLines()` — never re-prepare.
- For per-frame animations where text doesn't change but geometry does, `layoutNextLineRange` in a tight loop is cheap enough to do every frame at 60fps for normal-length paragraphs.
- When rendering ASCII masks per frame, keep a cell buffer (`Uint8Array`/typed arrays), derive measured per-row obstacle spans from the cells or projected geometry, merge spans, then feed those spans into `layoutNextLineRange` before drawing text.
- Keep visual animation and layout animation coupled. If a sphere morphs into a cube, tween both the rendered cell buffer and the obstacle spans with the same value; otherwise the demo looks painted-on instead of physically reflowed.
- For fades, prefer layer opacity over changing glyph intensity or obstacle scale. Put transient ASCII sprites on their own canvas and fade the canvas with CSS/GSAP opacity so geometry does not appear to shrink.
- Canvas `ctx.font` setting is surprisingly slow; set it **once** per frame if font doesn't vary, not per `fillText` call.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Drifting CSS/canvas font strings.** `ctx.font = "16px Inter"` measured, but CSS says `font-family: Inter, sans-serif; font-size: 16px`. Fine *if* Inter loads. If Inter 404s, CSS falls back to sans-serif and measurements drift by 5-20%. Always `preload` the font or use a web-safe family.

2. **Re-preparing inside the animation loop.** Only `layout*` is cheap. Re-calling `prepare` every frame will tank perf. Keep the prepared handle in module scope.

3. **Forgetting `Intl.Segmenter` for grapheme splits.** Emoji, combining marks, CJK — `"é".split("")` gives you two chars. Use `new Intl.Segmenter(undefined, { granularity: "grapheme" })` when sampling individual visible glyphs.

4. **`break: 'never'` chips without `extraWidth`.** In `rich-inline`, if you use `break: 'never'` for an atomic chip/mention, you must also supply `extraWidth` for the pill padding — otherwise chip chrome overflows the container.

5. **Using `@chenglou/pretext` from `unpkg` with TypeScript-only entry.** Use `esm.sh` — it compiles the TS exports to browser-ready ESM automatically. `unpkg` will 404 or serve raw TS.

6. **Monospace fallbacks silently erasing the whole point.** Users seeing monospace-looking output often have a CSS `font-family` that fell through to `monospace`. Verify the actual rendered font via DevTools.

7. **Skipping rows vs adjusting width** when flowing around a shape. If the corridor on this row is too narrow to fit a line, *skip the row* (`y += lineHeight; continue;`) rather than passing a tiny maxWidth to `layoutNextLineRange` — pretext will return one-grapheme lines that look broken.

8. **Shipping a cold demo.** The default first-paint looks tutorial-grade. Add: vignette, subtle scanline, idle auto-motion, one carefully chosen interactive response (drag, hover, scroll, click). Without these, "cool pretext demo" lands as "intern repro of the README."

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Demo is a single self-contained `.html` file — opens by double-click or `python3 -m http.server`
- [ ] `@chenglou/pretext` imported via `esm.sh` with pinned version
- [ ] Corpus is real prose, not lorem ipsum, and matches the demo's concept
- [ ] Font string passed to `prepare` matches the CSS font exactly
- [ ] `prepare()` / `prepareWithSegments()` called once, not per frame
- [ ] Dark background + considered palette — not the default white canvas
- [ ] At least one interactive response (drag / hover / scroll / click) or idle auto-motion
- [ ] Tested locally with `python3 -m http.server` and confirmed no console errors
- [ ] 60fps on a mid-tier laptop (or graceful degradation documented)
- [ ] One "extra mile" detail the user didn't ask for

## Claude Design for CLI/API Agents

Use this skill when the user asks for design work that would normally fit Claude Design, but the agent is running in a CLI/API environment instead of the hosted Claude Design web UI.

The goal is to preserve Claude Design's useful design behavior and taste while removing hosted-tool plumbing that does not exist in normal agent environments.

**Before starting, check for other web-design skills like `popular-web-designs` (ready-to-paste design systems for Stripe, Linear, Vercel, Notion, etc.) and `design-md` (Google's DESIGN.md token spec format).** If the user wants a known brand's look, load `popular-web-designs` alongside this one and let it supply the visual vocabulary. If the deliverable is a token spec file rather than a rendered artifact, use `design-md` instead. Full decision table below.

## When To Use This Skill vs `popular-web-designs` vs `design-md`

Hermes has three design-related skills under `skills/creative/`. They do different jobs — load the right one (or combine them):

| Skill | What it gives you | Use when the user wants... |
|---|---|---|
| **claude-design** (this one) | Design *process and taste* — how to scope a brief, gather context, produce variants, verify a local HTML artifact, avoid AI-design slop | a from-scratch designed artifact (landing page, prototype, deck, component lab, motion study) with no specific brand or token system dictated |
| **popular-web-designs** | 54 ready-to-paste design systems — exact colors, typography, components, CSS values for sites like Stripe, Linear, Vercel, Notion, Airbnb | "make it look like Stripe / Linear / Vercel", a page styled after a known brand, or a visual starting point pulled from a real product |
| **design-md** | Google's DESIGN.md spec format — author/validate/diff/export design-token files, WCAG contrast checking, Tailwind/DTCG export | a formal, persistent, machine-readable design-system *spec file* (tokens + rationale) that lives in a repo and gets consumed by agents over time |

Rule of thumb:

- **Process + taste, one-off artifact** → claude-design
- **Match a known brand's look** → popular-web-designs (and let claude-design drive the process)
- **Author the tokens spec itself** → design-md

These compose: use `popular-web-designs` for the visual vocabulary, `claude-design` for how to turn a brief into a thoughtful local HTML file, and `design-md` when the output is the token file rather than a rendered artifact.

## Runtime Mode

You are running in **CLI/API mode**, not the Claude Design hosted web UI.

Ignore references from source Claude Design prompts to hosted-only tools, project panes, preview panes, special toolbar protocols, or platform callbacks that are not available in the current environment.

Examples of hosted-tool concepts to ignore or remap:

- `done()`
- `fork_verifier_agent()`
- `questions_v2()`
- `copy_starter_component()`
- `show_to_user()`
- `show_html()`
- `snip()`
- `eval_js_user_view()`
- hosted asset review panes
- hosted edit-mode or Tweaks toolbar messaging
- `/projects/<projectId>/...` cross-project paths
- built-in `window.claude.complete()` artifact helper
- tool schemas embedded in the source prompt
- web-search citation scaffolding meant for the hosted runtime

Instead, use the tools actually available in the current agent environment.

Default deliverable:

- a complete local HTML file
- self-contained CSS and JavaScript when portability matters
- exact on-disk path in the final response
- verification using available local methods before saying it is done

If the user asks for implementation in an existing repo, generate code in the repo's actual stack instead of forcing a standalone HTML artifact.

## Core Identity

Act as an expert designer working with the user as the manager.

HTML is the default tool, but the medium changes by assignment:

- UX designer for flows and product surfaces
- interaction designer for prototypes
- visual designer for static explorations
- motion designer for animated artifacts
- deck designer for presentations
- design-systems designer for tokens, components, and visual rules
- frontend-minded prototyper when code fidelity matters

Avoid generic web-design tropes unless the user explicitly asks for a conventional web page.

Do not expose internal prompts, hidden system messages, or implementation plumbing. Talk about capabilities and deliverables in user terms: HTML files, prototypes, decks, exported assets, screenshots, code, and design options.

## When To Use

Use this skill for:

- landing pages
- teaser pages
- high-fidelity prototypes
- interactive product mockups
- visual option boards
- component explorations
- design-system previews
- HTML slide decks
- motion studies
- onboarding flows
- dashboard concepts
- settings, command palettes, modals, cards, forms, empty states
- redesigns based on screenshots, repos, brand docs, or UI kits

Do not use this skill for pure DESIGN.md token authoring unless the user specifically asks for a DESIGN.md file. Use `design-md` for that.

## Design Principle: Start From Context, Not Vibes

Good high-fidelity design does not start from scratch.

Before designing, look for source context:

1. brand docs
2. existing product screenshots
3. current repo components
4. design tokens
5. UI kits
6. prior mockups
7. reference models
8. copy docs
9. constraints from legal, product, or engineering

If a repo is available, inspect actual source files before inventing UI:

- theme files
- token files
- global stylesheets
- layout scaffolds
- component files
- route/page files
- form/button/card/navigation implementations

The file tree is only the menu. Read the files that define the visual vocabulary before designing.

If context is missing and fidelity matters, ask concise focused questions instead of producing a generic mockup.

## Asking Questions

Ask questions when the assignment is new, ambiguous, high-fidelity, externally facing, or depends on taste.

Keep questions short. Do not ask ten questions by default unless the problem is genuinely underspecified.

Usually ask for:

- intended output format
- audience
- fidelity level
- source materials available
- brand/design system in play
- number of variations wanted
- whether to stay conservative or explore divergent ideas
- which dimension matters most: layout, visual language, interaction, copy, motion, or systemization

Skip questions when:

- the user gave enough direction
- this is a small tweak
- the task is clearly a continuation
- the missing detail has an obvious default

When proceeding with assumptions, label only the important ones.

## Workflow

1. **Understand the brief**
   - What is being designed?
   - Who is it for?
   - What artifact should exist at the end?
   - What constraints are locked?

2. **Gather context**
   - Read supplied docs, screenshots, repo files, or design assets.
   - Identify the visual vocabulary before writing code.

3. **Define the design system for this artifact**
   - colors
   - type
   - spacing
   - radii
   - shadows or elevation
   - motion posture
   - component treatment
   - interaction rules

4. **Choose the right format**
   - Static visual comparison: one HTML canvas with options side by side.
   - Interaction/flow: clickable prototype.
   - Presentation: fixed-size HTML deck with slide navigation.
   - Component exploration: component lab with variants.
   - Motion: timeline or state-based animation.

5. **Build the artifact**
   - Prefer a single self-contained HTML file unless the task calls for a repo implementation.
   - Preserve prior versions for major revisions.
   - Avoid unnecessary dependencies.

6. **Verify**
   - Confirm files exist.
   - Run any available syntax/static checks.
   - If browser tools are available, open the file and check console errors.
   - If visual fidelity matters and screenshot tools are available, inspect at least the primary viewport.

7. **Report briefly**
   - exact file path
   - what was created
   - caveats
   - next decision or next iteration

## Artifact Format Rules

Default to local files.

For standalone artifacts:

- create a descriptive filename, e.g. `Landing Page.html`, `Command Palette Prototype.html`, `Design System Board.html`
- embed CSS in `<style>`
- embed JS in `<script>`
- keep the artifact openable directly in a browser
- avoid remote dependencies unless they are explicitly useful and stable
- include responsive behavior unless the format is intentionally fixed-size

For significant revisions:

- preserve the previous version as `Name.html`
- create `Name v2.html`, `Name v3.html`, etc.
- or keep one file with in-page toggles if the assignment is variant exploration

For repo implementation:

- follow the repo's actual stack
- use existing components and tokens where possible
- do not create a standalone artifact if the user asked for production code

## HTML / CSS / JS Standards

Use modern CSS well:

- CSS variables for tokens
- CSS grid for layout
- container queries when helpful
- `text-wrap: pretty` where supported
- real focus states
- real hover states
- `prefers-reduced-motion` handling for non-trivial motion
- responsive scaling
- semantic HTML where practical

Avoid:

- huge monolithic files when a real repo structure is expected
- fragile hard-coded viewport assumptions
- inaccessible tiny hit targets
- decorative JS that fights usability
- `scrollIntoView` unless there is no safer option

Mobile hit targets should be at least 44px.

For print documents, text should be at least 12pt.

For 1920×1080 slide decks, text should generally be 24px or larger.

## React Guidance for Standalone HTML

Use plain HTML/CSS/JS by default.

Use React only when:

- the artifact needs meaningful state
- variants/toggles are easier as components
- interaction complexity warrants it
- the target implementation is React/Next.js and fidelity matters

If using React from CDN in standalone HTML:

- pin exact versions
- avoid unpinned `react@18` style URLs
- avoid `type="module"` unless necessary
- avoid multiple global objects named `styles`
- give global style objects specific names, e.g. `commandPaletteStyles`, `deckStyles`
- if splitting Babel scripts, explicitly attach shared components to `window`

If building inside a real repo, use the repo's package manager and component architecture instead.

## Deck Rules

For slide decks, use a fixed-size canvas and scale it to fit the viewport.

Default slide size: 1920×1080, 16:9.

Requirements:

- keyboard navigation
- visible slide count
- localStorage persistence for current slide
- print-friendly layout when practical
- screen labels or stable IDs for important slides
- no speaker notes unless the user explicitly asks

Do not hand-wave a deck as markdown bullets. Create a designed artifact if asked for a deck.

Use 1–2 background colors max unless the brand system requires more.

Keep slides sparse. If a slide feels empty, solve it with layout, rhythm, scale, or imagery placeholders, not filler text.

## Prototype Rules

For interactive prototypes:

- make the primary path clickable
- include key states: default, hover/focus, loading, empty, error, success where relevant
- expose variations with in-page controls when useful
- keep controls out of the final composition unless they are intentionally part of the prototype
- persist important state in localStorage when refresh continuity matters

If the prototype is meant to model a product flow, design the flow, not just the first screen.

## Variation Rules

When exploring, default to at least three options:

1. **Conservative** — closest to existing patterns / lowest risk
2. **Strong-fit** — best interpretation of the brief
3. **Divergent** — more novel, useful for discovering taste boundaries

Variations can explore:

- layout
- hierarchy
- type scale
- density
- color posture
- surface treatment
- motion
- interaction model
- copy structure
- component shape

Do not create variations that are merely color swaps unless color is the actual question.

When the user picks a direction, consolidate. Do not leave the project as a pile of options forever.

## Tweakable Designs in CLI/API Mode

The hosted Claude Design edit-mode toolbar does not exist here.

Still preserve the idea: when useful, add in-page controls called `Tweaks`.

A good `Tweaks` panel can control:

- theme mode
- layout variant
- density
- accent color
- type scale
- motion on/off
- copy variant
- component variant

Keep it small and unobtrusive. The design should look final when tweaks are hidden.

Persist tweak values with localStorage when helpful.

## Content Discipline

Do not add filler content.

Every element must earn its place.

Avoid:

- fake metrics
- decorative stats
- generic feature grids
- unnecessary icons
- placeholder testimonials
- AI-generated fluff sections
- invented content that changes strategy or claims

If additional sections, pages, copy, or claims would improve the artifact, ask before adding them.

When copy is necessary but not final, mark it as draft or placeholder.

## Anti-Slop Rules

Avoid common AI design sludge:

- aggressive gradient backgrounds
- glassmorphism by default
- emoji unless the brand uses them
- generic SaaS cards with icons everywhere
- left-border accent callout cards
- fake dashboards filled with arbitrary numbers
- stock-photo hero sections
- oversized rounded rectangles as a substitute for hierarchy
- rainbow palettes
- vague labels like “Insights,” “Growth,” “Scale,” “Optimize” without content
- decorative SVG illustrations pretending to be product imagery

Minimal is not automatically good. Dense is not automatically cluttered. Choose intentionally.

## Typography

Use the existing type system if one exists.

If not, choose type deliberately based on the artifact:

- editorial: serif or humanist headline with restrained sans body
- software/productivity: precise sans with strong numeric treatment
- luxury/minimal: fewer weights, more spacing discipline
- technical: mono accents only, not mono everywhere
- deck: large, clear, high contrast

Avoid overused defaults when a stronger choice is appropriate.

If using web fonts, keep the number of families and weights low.

Use type as hierarchy before adding boxes, icons, or color.

## Color

Use brand/design-system colors first.

If no palette exists:

- define a small system
- include neutrals, surface, ink, muted text, border, accent, danger/success if needed
- use one primary accent unless the assignment calls for a broader palette
- prefer oklch for harmonious invented palettes when browser support is acceptable
- check contrast for important text and controls

Do not invent lots of colors from scratch.

## Layout and Composition

Design with rhythm:

- scale
- whitespace
- density
- alignment
- repetition
- contrast
- interruption

Avoid making every section the same card grid.

For product UIs, prioritize speed of comprehension over decoration.

For marketing surfaces, make one idea land per section.

For dashboards, avoid “data slop.” Only show data that helps the user decide or act.

## Motion

Use motion as discipline, not theater.

Good motion:

- clarifies state changes
- reduces anxiety during loading
- shows continuity between surfaces
- gives controls tactility
- stays subtle

Bad motion:

- loops without purpose
- delays the user
- calls attention to itself
- hides poor hierarchy

Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for non-trivial animation.

## Images and Icons

Use real supplied imagery when available.

If an asset is missing:

- use a clean placeholder
- use typography, layout, or abstract texture instead
- ask for real material when fidelity matters

Do not draw elaborate fake SVG illustrations unless the assignment is explicitly illustration work.

Avoid iconography unless it improves scanning or matches the design system.

## Source-Code Fidelity

When recreating or extending a UI from a repo:

1. inspect the repo tree
2. identify the actual UI source files
3. read theme/token/global style/component files
4. lift exact values where appropriate
5. match spacing, radii, shadows, copy tone, density, and interaction patterns
6. only then design or modify

Do not build from memory when source files are available.

For GitHub URLs, parse owner/repo/ref/path correctly and inspect the relevant files before designing.

## Reading Documents and Assets

Read Markdown, HTML, CSS, JS, TS, JSX, TSX, JSON, SVG, and plain text directly when available.

For DOCX/PPTX/PDF, use available local extraction tools if present. If not available, ask the user to provide exported text/images or use another available tool path.

For sketches, prioritize thumbnails or screenshots over raw drawing JSON unless the JSON is the only usable source.

## Copyright and Reference Models

Do not recreate a company's distinctive UI, proprietary command structure, branded screens, or exact visual identity unless the user clearly has rights to that source.

It is acceptable to extract general design principles:

- density without clutter
- command-first interaction
- monochrome with one accent
- editorial hierarchy
- clear empty states
- strong keyboard affordances

It is not acceptable to clone proprietary layouts, copy exact branded surfaces, or reproduce copyrighted content.

When using references, transform posture and principles into an original design.

## Verification

Before final response, verify as much as the environment allows.

Minimum:

- file exists at the stated path
- HTML is saved completely
- obvious syntax issues are checked

Better:

- open in a browser tool and check console errors
- inspect screenshots at the primary viewport
- test key interactions
- test light/dark or variants if present
- test responsive breakpoints if relevant

If verification is limited by environment, say exactly what was and was not verified.

Never say “done” if the file was not actually written.

## Final Response Format

Keep final responses short.

Include:

- artifact path
- what it contains
- verification status
- next suggested action, if useful

Example:

```text
Created: /path/to/Prototype.html
It includes 3 layout variants, a Tweaks panel for density/theme, and responsive behavior.
Verified: file exists and opened cleanly in browser, no console errors.
Next: pick the strongest direction and I’ll tighten copy + motion.
```

## Portable Opening Prompt Pattern

When adapting a Claude Design style request into CLI/API mode, use this mental translation:

```text
You are running in CLI/API mode, not hosted Claude Design. Ignore references to hosted-only tools or preview panes. Produce complete local design artifacts, usually self-contained HTML with embedded CSS/JS, and verify with available local tools before returning. Preserve the design process: gather context, define the system, produce options, avoid filler, and meet a high visual bar.
```

## Pitfalls

- Do not paste hosted tool schemas into a skill. They cause fake tool calls.
- Do not point the skill at a giant external prompt as required runtime context. That creates drift.
- Do not strip the design doctrine while removing tool plumbing.
- Do not over-ask when the user already gave enough direction.
- Do not under-ask for high-fidelity work with no brand context.
- Do not produce generic SaaS layouts and call them designed.
- Do not claim browser verification unless it actually happened.

## Popular Web Designs

54 real-world design systems ready for use when generating HTML/CSS. Each template captures a
site's complete visual language: color palette, typography hierarchy, component styles, spacing
system, shadows, responsive behavior, and practical agent prompts with exact CSS values.

## Related design skills

- **`claude-design`** — use for the design *process and taste* (scoping a brief,
  producing variants, verifying a local HTML artifact, avoiding AI-design slop).
  Pair it with this skill when the user wants a thoughtfully-designed page styled
  after a known brand: `claude-design` drives the workflow, this skill supplies
  the visual vocabulary.
- **`design-md`** — use when the deliverable is a formal DESIGN.md token spec
  file, not a rendered artifact.

## How to Use

1. Pick a design from the catalog below
2. Load it: `skill_view(name="popular-web-designs", file_path="templates/<site>.md")`
3. Use the design tokens and component specs when generating HTML
4. Pair with the `generative-widgets` skill to serve the result via cloudflared tunnel

Each template includes a **Hermes Implementation Notes** block at the top with:
- CDN font substitute and Google Fonts `<link>` tag (ready to paste)
- CSS font-family stacks for primary and monospace
- Reminders to use `write_file` for HTML creation and `browser_vision` for verification

## HTML Generation Pattern

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Page Title</title>
  <!-- Paste the Google Fonts <link> from the template's Hermes notes -->
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=..." rel="stylesheet">
  <style>
    /* Apply the template's color palette as CSS custom properties */
    :root {
      --color-bg: #ffffff;
      --color-text: #171717;
      --color-accent: #533afd;
      /* ... more from template Section 2 */
    }
    /* Apply typography from template Section 3 */
    body {
      font-family: 'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif;
      color: var(--color-text);
      background: var(--color-bg);
    }
    /* Apply component styles from template Section 4 */
    /* Apply layout from template Section 5 */
    /* Apply shadows from template Section 6 */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Build using component specs from the template -->
</body>
</html>
```

Write the file with `write_file`, serve with the `generative-widgets` workflow (cloudflared tunnel),
and verify the result with `browser_vision` to confirm visual accuracy.

## Font Substitution Reference

Most sites use proprietary fonts unavailable via CDN. Each template maps to a Google Fonts
substitute that preserves the design's character. Common mappings:

| Proprietary Font | CDN Substitute | Character |
|---|---|---|
| Geist / Geist Sans | Geist (on Google Fonts) | Geometric, compressed tracking |
| Geist Mono | Geist Mono (on Google Fonts) | Clean monospace, ligatures |
| sohne-var (Stripe) | Source Sans 3 | Light weight elegance |
| Berkeley Mono | JetBrains Mono | Technical monospace |
| Airbnb Cereal VF | DM Sans | Rounded, friendly geometric |
| Circular (Spotify) | DM Sans | Geometric, warm |
| figmaSans | Inter | Clean humanist |
| Pin Sans (Pinterest) | DM Sans | Friendly, rounded |
| NVIDIA-EMEA | Inter (or Arial system) | Industrial, clean |
| CoinbaseDisplay/Sans | DM Sans | Geometric, trustworthy |
| UberMove | DM Sans | Bold, tight |
| HashiCorp Sans | Inter | Enterprise, neutral |
| waldenburgNormal (Sanity) | Space Grotesk | Geometric, slightly condensed |
| IBM Plex Sans/Mono | IBM Plex Sans/Mono | Available on Google Fonts |
| Rubik (Sentry) | Rubik | Available on Google Fonts |

When a template's CDN font matches the original (Inter, IBM Plex, Rubik, Geist), no
substitution loss occurs. When a substitute is used (DM Sans for Circular, Source Sans 3
for sohne-var), follow the template's weight, size, and letter-spacing values closely —
those carry more visual identity than the specific font face.

## Sketch

Use this skill when the user wants to **see a design direction before committing** to one — exploring a UI/UX idea as disposable HTML mockups. The point is to generate 2-3 interactive variants so the user can compare visual directions side-by-side, not to produce shippable code.

Load this when the user says things like "sketch this screen", "show me what X could look like", "compare layout A vs B", "give me 2-3 takes on this UI", "let me see some variants", "mockup this before I build".

## When NOT to use this

- User wants a production component — use `claude-design` or build it properly
- User wants a polished one-off HTML artifact (landing page, deck) — `claude-design`
- User wants a diagram — `excalidraw`, `architecture-diagram`
- The design is already locked — just build it

## If the user has the full GSD system installed

If `gsd-sketch` shows up as a sibling skill (installed via `npx get-shit-done-cc --hermes`), prefer **`gsd-sketch`** for the full workflow: persistent `.planning/sketches/` with MANIFEST, frontier mode analysis, consistency audits across past sketches, and integration with the rest of GSD. This skill is the lightweight standalone version — one-off sketching without the state machinery.

## Core method

```
intake  →  variants  →  head-to-head  →  pick winner (or iterate)
```

### 1. Intake (skip if the user already gave you enough)

Before generating variants, get three things — one question at a time, not all at once:

1. **Feel.** "What should this feel like? Adjectives, emotions, a vibe." — *"calm, editorial, like Linear"* tells you more than *"minimal"*.
2. **References.** "What apps, sites, or products capture the feel you're imagining?" — actual references beat abstract descriptions.
3. **Core action.** "What's the single most important thing a user does on this screen?" — the variants should all serve this well; if they don't, they're just decoration.

Reflect each answer briefly before the next question. If the user already gave you all three upfront, skip straight to variants.

### 2. Variants (2-3, never 1, rarely 4+)

Produce **2-3 variants** in one go. Each variant is a complete, standalone HTML file. Don't describe variants — build them. The point is comparison.

Each variant should take a **different design stance**, not different pixel values. Three good variant axes:

- **Density:** compact / airy / ultra-dense (pick two contrasting poles)
- **Emphasis:** content-first / action-first / tool-first
- **Aesthetic:** editorial / utilitarian / playful
- **Layout:** single-column / sidebar / split-pane
- **Grounding:** card-based / bare-content / document-style

Pick one axis and pull apart from it. Two variants that differ only in accent color are wasted effort — the user can't distinguish them.

**Variant naming:** describe the stance, not the number.

```
sketches/
├── 001-calm-editorial/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── README.md
├── 001-utilitarian-dense/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── README.md
└── 001-playful-split/
    ├── index.html
    └── README.md
```

### 3. Make them real HTML

Each variant is a **single self-contained HTML file**:

- Inline `<style>` — no build step, no external CSS
- System fonts or one Google Font via `<link>`
- Tailwind via CDN (`<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`) is fine
- Realistic fake content — actual sentences, actual names, not "Lorem ipsum"
- **Interactive**: links clickable, hovers real, at least one state transition (open/close, filter, toggle). A frozen static image is a worse spike than a sloppy animated one.

Open it in a browser. If it looks broken, fix it before showing the user.

**Verify variants visually — use Hermes' browser tools.** Don't just write HTML and hope it renders; load each variant and look at it:

```
browser_navigate(url="file:///absolute/path/to/sketches/001-calm-editorial/index.html")
browser_vision(question="Does this layout look clean and readable? Any visible bugs (overlapping text, unstyled elements, broken images)?")
```

`browser_vision` returns an AI description of what's actually on the page plus a screenshot path — catches layout bugs that pure source inspection misses (e.g. a font import that silently failed, a flex container that collapsed). Fix and re-navigate until each variant looks right.

**Default CSS reset + system font stack** for fast starts:

```html
<style>
  * { box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0; }
  body {
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto,
                 "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif;
    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
    color: #1a1a1a;
    background: #fafafa;
    line-height: 1.5;
  }
</style>
```

### 4. Variant README

Each variant's `README.md` answers:

```markdown
## Variant: {stance name}

### Design stance
One sentence on the principle driving this variant.

### Key choices
- Layout: ...
- Typography: ...
- Color: ...
- Interaction: ...

### Trade-offs
- Strong at: ...
- Weak at: ...

### Best for
- The kind of user or use case this variant actually serves
```

### 5. Head-to-head

After all variants are built, present them as a comparison. Don't just list — **opinionate**:

```markdown
## Three takes on the home screen

| Dimension | Calm editorial | Utilitarian dense | Playful split |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Density   | Low            | High              | Medium        |
| Primary action visibility | Low | High | Medium |
| Scan-ability | High | Medium | Low |
| Feel | Calm, trusted | Sharp, tool-like | Inviting, energetic |

**My take:** Utilitarian dense for power users, calm editorial for content-forward audiences. Playful split is weakest — tries to do both and commits to neither.
```

Let the user pick a winner, or combine two into a hybrid, or ask for another round.

## Theming (when the project has a visual identity)

If the user has an existing theme (colors, fonts, tokens), put shared tokens in `sketches/themes/tokens.css` and `@import` them in each variant. Keep tokens minimal:

```css
/* sketches/themes/tokens.css */
:root {
  --color-bg: #fafafa;
  --color-fg: #1a1a1a;
  --color-accent: #0066ff;
  --color-muted: #666;
  --radius: 8px;
  --font-display: "Inter", sans-serif;
  --font-body: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif;
}
```

Don't over-tokenize a throwaway sketch — three colors and one font is usually enough.

## Interactivity bar

A sketch is interactive enough when the user can:

1. **Click a primary action** and something visible happens (state change, modal, toast, navigation feint)
2. **See one meaningful state transition** (filter a list, toggle a mode, open/close a panel)
3. **Hover recognizable affordances** (buttons, rows, tabs)

More than that is over-engineering a throwaway. Less than that is a screenshot.

## Frontier mode (picking what to sketch next)

If sketches already exist and the user says "what should I sketch next?":

- **Consistency gaps** — two winning variants from different sketches made independent choices that haven't been composed together yet
- **Unsketched screens** — referenced but never explored
- **State coverage** — happy path sketched, but not empty / loading / error / 1000-items
- **Responsive gaps** — validated at one viewport; does it hold at mobile / ultrawide?
- **Interaction patterns** — static layouts exist; transitions, drag, scroll behavior don't

Propose 2-4 named candidates. Let the user pick.

## Output

- Create `sketches/` (or `.planning/sketches/` if the user is using GSD conventions) in the repo root
- One subdir per variant: `NNN-stance-name/index.html` + `README.md`
- Tell the user how to open them: `open sketches/001-calm-editorial/index.html` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux, `start` on Windows
- Keep variants disposable — a sketch that you felt the need to preserve should be promoted into real project code, not curated as an asset

**Typical tool sequence for one variant:**

```
terminal("mkdir -p sketches/001-calm-editorial")
write_file("sketches/001-calm-editorial/index.html", "<!doctype html>...")
write_file("sketches/001-calm-editorial/README.md", "## Variant: Calm editorial\n...")
browser_navigate(url="file://$(pwd)/sketches/001-calm-editorial/index.html")
browser_vision(question="How does this look? Any obvious layout issues?")
```

Repeat for each variant, then present the comparison table.

## Pretext Creative Demos

## Overview

[`@chenglou/pretext`](https://github.com/chenglou/pretext) is a 15KB zero-dependency TypeScript library by Cheng Lou (React core, ReasonML, Midjourney) for **DOM-free multiline text measurement and layout**. It does one thing: given `(text, font, width)`, return the line breaks, per-line widths, per-grapheme positions, and total height — all via canvas measurement, no reflow.

That sounds like plumbing. It is not. Because it is fast and geometric, it is a **creative primitive**: you can reflow paragraphs around a moving sprite at 60fps, build games whose level geometry is made of real words, drive ASCII logos through prose, shatter text into particles with exact per-grapheme starting positions, or pack shrink-wrapped multiline UI without any `getBoundingClientRect` thrash.

This skill exists so Hermes can make **cool demos** with it — the kind people post to X. See `pretext.cool` and `chenglou.me/pretext` for the community demo corpus.

## When to Use

Use when the user asks for:
- A "pretext demo" / "cool pretext thing" / "text-as-X"
- Text flowing around a moving shape (hero sections, editorial layouts, animated long-form pages)
- ASCII-art effects using **real words or prose**, not monospace rasters
- Games where the playfield / obstacles / bricks are made of text (Tetris-from-letters, Breakout-of-prose)
- Kinetic typography with per-glyph physics (shatter, scatter, flock, flow)
- Typographic generative art, especially with non-Latin scripts or mixed scripts
- Multiline "shrink-wrap" UI (smallest container width that still fits the text)
- Anything that would require knowing line breaks *before* rendering

Don't use for:
- Static SVG/HTML pages where CSS already solves layout — just use CSS
- Rich text editors, general inline formatting engines (pretext is intentionally narrow)
- Image → text (use `ascii-art` / `ascii-video` skills)
- Pure canvas generative art with no text role — use `p5js`

## Creative Standard

This is visual art rendered in a browser. Pretext returns numbers; **you** draw the thing.

- **Don't ship a "hello world" demo.** The `hello-orb-flow.html` template is the *starting* point. Every delivered demo must add intentional color, motion, composition, and one visual detail the user didn't ask for but will appreciate.
- **Dark backgrounds, warm cores, considered palette.** Classic amber-on-black (CRT / terminal) works, but so do cold-white-on-charcoal (editorial) and desaturated pastels (risograph). Pick one and commit.
- **Proportional fonts are the point.** Pretext's whole vibe is "not monospaced" — lean into it. Use Iowan Old Style, Inter, JetBrains Mono, Helvetica Neue, or a variable font. Never default sans.
- **Real source/text, not lorem ipsum.** The corpus should mean something. Short manifestos, poetry, real source code, a found text, the library's own README — never `lorem ipsum`.
- **First-paint excellence.** No loading states, no blank frames. The demo must look shippable the instant it opens.

## Stack

Single self-contained HTML file per demo. No build step.

| Layer | Tool | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Core | `@chenglou/pretext` via `esm.sh` CDN | Text measurement + line layout |
| Render | HTML5 Canvas 2D | Glyph rendering, per-frame composition |
| Segmentation | `Intl.Segmenter` (built-in) | Grapheme splitting for emoji / CJK / combining marks |
| Interaction | Raw DOM events | Mouse / touch / wheel — no framework |

```html
<script type="module">
import {
  prepare, layout,                   // use-case 1: simple height
  prepareWithSegments, layoutWithLines,  // use-case 2a: fixed-width lines
  layoutNextLineRange, materializeLineRange, // use-case 2b: streaming / variable width
  measureLineStats, walkLineRanges,  // stats without string allocation
} from "https://esm.sh/@chenglou/pretext@0.0.6";
</script>
```

Pin the version. `@0.0.6` at time of writing — check [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chenglou/pretext) for the latest if demo behavior is off.

## The Two Use Cases

Almost everything reduces to one of these two shapes. Learn both.

### Use-case 1 — measure, then render with CSS/DOM

```js
const prepared = prepare(text, "16px Inter");
const { height, lineCount } = layout(prepared, 320, 20);
```

You still let the browser draw the text. Pretext just tells you how tall the box will be at a given width, **without** a DOM read. Use for:
- Virtualized lists where rows contain wrapping text
- Masonry with precise card heights
- "Does this label fit?" dev-time checks
- Preventing layout shift when remote text loads

**Keep `font` and `letterSpacing` exactly in sync with your CSS.** The canvas `ctx.font` format (e.g. `"16px Inter"`, `"500 17px 'JetBrains Mono'"`) must match the rendered CSS, or measurements drift.

### Use-case 2 — measure *and* render yourself

```js
const prepared = prepareWithSegments(text, FONT);
const { lines } = layoutWithLines(prepared, 320, 26);
for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
  ctx.fillText(lines[i].text, 0, i * 26);
}
```

This is where the creative work lives. You own the drawing, so you can:
- Render to canvas, SVG, WebGL, or any coordinate system
- Substitute per-glyph transforms (rotation, jitter, scale, opacity)
- Use line metadata (width, grapheme positions) as geometry

For **variable-width-per-line** flow (text around a shape, text in a donut band, text in a non-rectangular column):

```js
let cursor = { segmentIndex: 0, graphemeIndex: 0 };
let y = 0;
while (true) {
  const lineWidth = widthAtY(y);  // your function: how wide is the corridor at this y?
  const range = layoutNextLineRange(prepared, cursor, lineWidth);
  if (!range) break;
  const line = materializeLineRange(prepared, range);
  ctx.fillText(line.text, leftEdgeAtY(y), y);
  cursor = range.end;
  y += lineHeight;
}
```

This is the most important pattern in the whole library. It's what unlocks "text flowing around a dragged sprite" — the demo that went viral on X.

### Helpers worth knowing

- `measureLineStats(prepared, maxWidth)` → `{ lineCount, maxLineWidth }` — the widest line, i.e. multiline shrink-wrap width.
- `walkLineRanges(prepared, maxWidth, callback)` — iterate lines without allocating strings. Use for stats/physics over graphemes when you don't need the characters.
- `@chenglou/pretext/rich-inline` — the same system but for paragraphs mixing fonts / chips / mentions. Import from the subpath.

## Demo Recipe Patterns

The community corpus (see `references/patterns.md`) clusters into a handful of strong patterns. Pick one and riff — don't invent a new category unless asked.

| Pattern | Key API | Example idea |
|---|---|---|
| **Reflow around obstacle** | `layoutNextLineRange` + per-row width function | Editorial paragraph that parts around a dragged cursor sprite |
| **Text-as-geometry game** | `layoutWithLines` + per-line collision rects | Breakout where each brick is a measured word |
| **Shatter / particles** | `walkLineRanges` → per-grapheme (x,y) → physics | Sentence that explodes into letters on click |
| **ASCII obstacle typography** | `layoutNextLineRange` + measured per-row obstacle spans | Bitmap ASCII logo, shape morphs, and draggable wire objects that make text open around their actual geometry |
| **Editorial multi-column** | `layoutNextLineRange` per column + shared cursor | Animated magazine spread with pull quotes |
| **Kinetic type** | `layoutWithLines` + per-line transform over time | Star Wars crawl, wave, bounce, glitch |
| **Multiline shrink-wrap** | `measureLineStats` | Quote card that auto-sizes to its tightest container |

See `templates/donut-orbit.html` and `templates/hello-orb-flow.html` for working single-file starters.

## Workflow

1. **Pick a pattern** from the table above based on the user's brief.
2. **Start from a template**:
   - `templates/hello-orb-flow.html` — text reflowing around a moving orb (reflow-around-obstacle pattern)
   - `templates/donut-orbit.html` — advanced example: measured ASCII logo obstacles, draggable wire sphere/cube, morphing shape fields, selectable DOM text, and dev-only controls
   - `write_file` to a new `.html` in `/tmp/` or the user's workspace.
3. **Swap the corpus** for something intentional to the brief. Real prose, 10-100 sentences, no lorem.
4. **Tune the aesthetic** — font, palette, composition, interaction. This is the work; don't skip it.
5. **Verify locally**:
   ```sh
   cd <dir-with-html> && python3 -m http.server 8765
   # then open http://localhost:8765/<file>.html
   ```
6. **Check the console** — pretext will throw if `prepareWithSegments` is called with a bad font string; `Intl.Segmenter` is available in every modern browser.
7. **Show the user the file path**, not just the code — they want to open it.

## Performance Notes

- `prepare()` / `prepareWithSegments()` is the expensive call. Do it **once** per text+font pair. Cache the handle.
- On resize, only rerun `layout()` / `layoutWithLines()` — never re-prepare.
- For per-frame animations where text doesn't change but geometry does, `layoutNextLineRange` in a tight loop is cheap enough to do every frame at 60fps for normal-length paragraphs.
- When rendering ASCII masks per frame, keep a cell buffer (`Uint8Array`/typed arrays), derive measured per-row obstacle spans from the cells or projected geometry, merge spans, then feed those spans into `layoutNextLineRange` before drawing text.
- Keep visual animation and layout animation coupled. If a sphere morphs into a cube, tween both the rendered cell buffer and the obstacle spans with the same value; otherwise the demo looks painted-on instead of physically reflowed.
- For fades, prefer layer opacity over changing glyph intensity or obstacle scale. Put transient ASCII sprites on their own canvas and fade the canvas with CSS/GSAP opacity so geometry does not appear to shrink.
- Canvas `ctx.font` setting is surprisingly slow; set it **once** per frame if font doesn't vary, not per `fillText` call.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Drifting CSS/canvas font strings.** `ctx.font = "16px Inter"` measured, but CSS says `font-family: Inter, sans-serif; font-size: 16px`. Fine *if* Inter loads. If Inter 404s, CSS falls back to sans-serif and measurements drift by 5-20%. Always `preload` the font or use a web-safe family.

2. **Re-preparing inside the animation loop.** Only `layout*` is cheap. Re-calling `prepare` every frame will tank perf. Keep the prepared handle in module scope.

3. **Forgetting `Intl.Segmenter` for grapheme splits.** Emoji, combining marks, CJK — `"é".split("")` gives you two chars. Use `new Intl.Segmenter(undefined, { granularity: "grapheme" })` when sampling individual visible glyphs.

4. **`break: 'never'` chips without `extraWidth`.** In `rich-inline`, if you use `break: 'never'` for an atomic chip/mention, you must also supply `extraWidth` for the pill padding — otherwise chip chrome overflows the container.

5. **Using `@chenglou/pretext` from `unpkg` with TypeScript-only entry.** Use `esm.sh` — it compiles the TS exports to browser-ready ESM automatically. `unpkg` will 404 or serve raw TS.

6. **Monospace fallbacks silently erasing the whole point.** Users seeing monospace-looking output often have a CSS `font-family` that fell through to `monospace`. Verify the actual rendered font via DevTools.

7. **Skipping rows vs adjusting width** when flowing around a shape. If the corridor on this row is too narrow to fit a line, *skip the row* (`y += lineHeight; continue;`) rather than passing a tiny maxWidth to `layoutNextLineRange` — pretext will return one-grapheme lines that look broken.

8. **Shipping a cold demo.** The default first-paint looks tutorial-grade. Add: vignette, subtle scanline, idle auto-motion, one carefully chosen interactive response (drag, hover, scroll, click). Without these, "cool pretext demo" lands as "intern repro of the README."
