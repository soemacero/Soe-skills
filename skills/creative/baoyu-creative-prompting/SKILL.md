# Baoyu Creative Prompting


---

## Article Illustrator

Adapted from [baoyu-article-illustrator](https://github.com/JimLiu/baoyu-skills) for Hermes Agent's tool ecosystem.

Analyze articles, identify illustration positions, generate images with **Type × Style × Palette** consistency.

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when the user asks to illustrate an article, add images to an article, generate illustrations for content, or uses phrases like "为文章配图", "illustrate article", or "add images". The user provides an article (file path or pasted content) and optionally specifies type, style, palette, or density.

## Three Dimensions

| Dimension | Controls | Examples |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Type** | Information structure | infographic, scene, flowchart, comparison, framework, timeline |
| **Style** | Rendering approach | notion, warm, minimal, blueprint, watercolor, elegant |
| **Palette** | Color scheme (optional) | macaron, warm, neon — overrides style's default colors |

Combine freely: `type=infographic, style=vector-illustration, palette=macaron`.

Or use presets: `edu-visual` → type + style + palette in one shot. See [style-presets.md](references/style-presets.md).

## Types

| Type | Best For |
|------|----------|
| `infographic` | Data, metrics, technical |
| `scene` | Narratives, emotional |
| `flowchart` | Processes, workflows |
| `comparison` | Side-by-side, options |
| `framework` | Models, architecture |
| `timeline` | History, evolution |

## Styles

See [references/styles.md](references/styles.md) for Core Styles, the full gallery, and Type × Style compatibility.

## Output Structure

```
{output-dir}/
├── source-{slug}.{ext}    # Only for pasted content
├── outline.md
├── prompts/
│   └── NN-{type}-{slug}.md
└── NN-{type}-{slug}.png
```

**Default output directory**:

| Input | Output Directory | Markdown Insert Path |
|-------|------------------|----------------------|
| Article file path | `{article-dir}/imgs/` | `imgs/NN-{type}-{slug}.png` |
| Pasted content | `illustrations/{topic-slug}/` (cwd) | `illustrations/{topic-slug}/NN-{type}-{slug}.png` |

If the user asks for a different layout (e.g., images alongside the article, or a `illustrations/` subdirectory), honor that.

**Slug**: 2-4 words, kebab-case. **Conflict**: append `-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.

## Core Principles

- **Visualize concepts, not metaphors** — if the article uses a metaphor (e.g., "电锯切西瓜"), illustrate the underlying concept, not the literal image.
- **Labels use article data** — actual numbers, terms, and quotes from the article, not generic placeholders.
- **Prompt files are reproducibility records** — every illustration must have a saved prompt file under `prompts/` before any image is generated.
- **Strip secrets** — scan source content for API keys, tokens, or credentials before writing anything to disk.

## Workflow

```
- [ ] Step 1: Detect reference images (if provided)
- [ ] Step 2: Analyze content
- [ ] Step 3: Confirm settings (clarify tool, one question at a time)
- [ ] Step 4: Generate outline
- [ ] Step 5: Generate prompts
- [ ] Step 6: Generate images (image_generate)
- [ ] Step 7: Finalize
```

### Step 1: Detect Reference Images

If the user supplies reference images (paths pasted inline, attachments, or a URL):

1. For each reference, call `vision_analyze` with the path/URL and a question asking for style, palette, composition, and subject. Record the returned description in `{output-dir}/references/NN-ref-{slug}.md` via `write_file`.
2. **Do not** try to copy the binary via `write_file` / `read_file` — those are text-only. If you want a local copy for the record, use `terminal` (`cp "$src" "{output-dir}/references/NN-ref-{slug}.{ext}"`). The skill itself never needs to read the binary; it works off the vision description.
3. Since `image_generate` doesn't take image inputs, the vision description is what gets embedded in prompts during Step 5.

Full procedures: [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md#step-1-detect-reference-images).

### Step 2: Analyze

| Analysis | Output |
|----------|--------|
| Content type | Technical / Tutorial / Methodology / Narrative |
| Purpose | information / visualization / imagination |
| Core arguments | 2-5 main points |
| Positions | Where illustrations add value |

Read source (file path → `read_file`, or pasted text) and write the analysis to `{output-dir}/analysis.md` using `write_file`.

Full procedures: [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md#step-2-analyze).

### Step 3: Confirm Settings

Use the `clarify` tool. Since `clarify` handles one question at a time, ask the most important question first. Skip any question whose answer is already present in the user's request.

| Order | Question | Options |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Q1 | **Preset or Type** | [Recommended preset], [alt preset], or manual: infographic, scene, flowchart, comparison, framework, timeline, mixed |
| Q2 | **Density** | minimal (1-2), balanced (3-5), per-section (Recommended), rich (6+) |
| Q3 | **Style** *(skip if preset chosen in Q1)* | [Recommended], minimal-flat, sci-fi, hand-drawn, editorial, scene, poster |
| Q4 | **Palette** *(optional)* | Default (style colors), macaron, warm, neon |
| Q5 | **Language** *(only if article language is ambiguous)* | article language / user language |

Don't ask more than 2-3 `clarify` questions in a row. If the user already specified these in their request, skip entirely.

Full procedures: [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md#step-3-confirm-settings).

### Step 4: Generate Outline → `outline.md`

Save `{output-dir}/outline.md` using `write_file` with frontmatter (type, density, style, palette, image_count) and one entry per illustration:

```yaml
## Illustration 1
**Position**: [section/paragraph]
**Purpose**: [why]
**Visual Content**: [what to show]
**Filename**: 01-infographic-concept-name.png
```

Full template: [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md#step-4-generate-outline).

### Step 5: Generate Prompts

**BLOCKING**: Every illustration must have a saved prompt file before any image is generated — the prompt file is the reproducibility record.

For each illustration:

1. Create a prompt file per [references/prompt-construction.md](references/prompt-construction.md).
2. Save to `{output-dir}/prompts/NN-{type}-{slug}.md` using `write_file` with YAML frontmatter.
3. Prompts MUST use type-specific templates with structured sections (ZONES / LABELS / COLORS / STYLE / ASPECT).
4. LABELS MUST include article-specific data: actual numbers, terms, metrics, quotes.
5. Process references (`direct`/`style`/`palette`) per prompt frontmatter — for `direct` usage, embed a textual description of the reference in the prompt (since `image_generate` doesn't take reference-image inputs).

### Step 6: Generate Images

For each prompt file:

1. Call `image_generate(prompt=..., aspect_ratio=...)`. `image_generate` returns a JSON result containing an image URL; it does NOT write to disk and does NOT accept an output path.
2. Map the prompt's `ASPECT` to `image_generate`'s enum: `16:9` → `landscape`, `9:16` → `portrait`, `1:1` → `square`. Custom ratios → nearest named aspect.
3. Download the returned URL to `{output-dir}/NN-{type}-{slug}.png` via `terminal` (e.g. `curl -sSL -o "{output-dir}/NN-{type}-{slug}.png" "{url}"`).
4. On generation failure, auto-retry once.

Note: the underlying image-generation backend is user-configured (default: FAL FLUX 2 Klein 9B) and is NOT agent-selectable via `image_generate`. Do not write model names into prompts expecting them to route.

### Step 7: Finalize

Insert `![description]({relative-path}/NN-{type}-{slug}.png)` after the corresponding paragraph. Alt text: concise description in the article's language.

Report:

```
Article Illustration Complete!
Article: [path] | Type: [type] | Density: [level] | Style: [style] | Palette: [palette or default]
Images: X/N generated
```

## Modification

| Action | Steps |
|--------|-------|
| Edit | Update prompt → Regenerate → Update reference |
| Add | Position → Prompt → Generate → Update outline → Insert |
| Delete | Delete files → Remove reference → Update outline |

## References

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md) | Detailed procedures |
| [references/usage.md](references/usage.md) | Invocation examples |
| [references/styles.md](references/styles.md) | Style gallery + Palette gallery |
| [references/style-presets.md](references/style-presets.md) | Preset shortcuts (type + style + palette) |
| [references/prompt-construction.md](references/prompt-construction.md) | Prompt templates |

## Pitfalls

1. **Data integrity is paramount** — never summarize, paraphrase, or alter source statistics. "73% increase" stays "73% increase".
2. **Strip secrets** — scan source content for API keys, tokens, or credentials before including in any output file.
3. **Don't illustrate metaphors literally** — visualize the underlying concept.
4. **Prompt files are mandatory** — no image generation without a saved prompt file. The file is what lets you regenerate or switch backends later.
5. **`image_generate` aspect ratios** — the tool supports `landscape`, `portrait`, and `square`. Custom ratios map to the nearest option.
6. **`image_generate` returns a URL, not a local file** — always download via `terminal` (`curl`) before inserting local image paths into the article.
7. **No backend selection from the agent** — `image_generate` uses whatever model the user configured (default: FAL FLUX 2 Klein 9B). Don't write `"use <model> to generate this"` into prompts expecting it to route.

## Knowledge Comic Creator

Adapted from [baoyu-comic](https://github.com/JimLiu/baoyu-skills) for Hermes Agent's tool ecosystem.

Create original knowledge comics with flexible art style × tone combinations.

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when the user asks to create a knowledge/educational comic, biography comic, tutorial comic, or uses terms like "知识漫画", "教育漫画", or "Logicomix-style". The user provides content (text, file path, URL, or topic) and optionally specifies art style, tone, layout, aspect ratio, or language.

## Reference Images

Hermes' `image_generate` tool is **prompt-only** — it accepts a text prompt and an aspect ratio, and returns an image URL. It does **NOT** accept reference images. When the user supplies a reference image, use it to **extract traits in text** that get embedded in every page prompt:

**Intake**: Accept file paths when the user provides them (or pastes images in conversation).
- File path(s) → copy to `refs/NN-ref-{slug}.{ext}` alongside the comic output for provenance
- Pasted image with no path → ask the user for the path via `clarify`, or extract style traits verbally as a text fallback
- No reference → skip this section

**Usage modes** (per reference):

| Usage | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `style` | Extract style traits (line treatment, texture, mood) and append to every page's prompt body |
| `palette` | Extract hex colors and append to every page's prompt body |
| `scene` | Extract scene composition or subject notes and append to the relevant page(s) |

**Record in each page's prompt frontmatter** when refs exist:

```yaml
references:
  - ref_id: 01
    filename: 01-ref-scene.png
    usage: style
    traits: "muted earth tones, soft-edged ink wash, low-contrast backgrounds"
```

Character consistency is driven by **text descriptions** in `characters/characters.md` (written in Step 3) that get embedded inline in every page prompt (Step 5). The optional PNG character sheet generated in Step 7.1 is a human-facing review artifact, not an input to `image_generate`.

## Options

### Visual Dimensions

- **Compatibility matrix** and **content-signal → preset** table live in [references/auto-selection.md](references/auto-selection.md). Read it before recommending combinations in Step 2.

## File Structure

Output directory: `comic/{topic-slug}/`
- Slug: 2-4 words kebab-case from topic (e.g., `alan-turing-bio`)
- Conflict: append timestamp (e.g., `turing-story-20260118-143052`)

**Contents**:
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `source-{slug}.md` | Saved source content (kebab-case slug matches the output directory) |
| `analysis.md` | Content analysis |
| `storyboard.md` | Storyboard with panel breakdown |
| `characters/characters.md` | Character definitions |
| `characters/characters.png` | Character reference sheet (downloaded from `image_generate`) |
| `prompts/NN-{cover\|page}-[slug].md` | Generation prompts |
| `NN-{cover\|page}-[slug].png` | Generated images (downloaded from `image_generate`) |
| `refs/NN-ref-{slug}.{ext}` | User-supplied reference images (optional, for provenance) |

## Language Handling

**Detection Priority**:
1. User-specified language (explicit option)
2. User's conversation language
3. Source content language

**Rule**: Use user's input language for ALL interactions:
- Storyboard outlines and scene descriptions
- Image generation prompts
- User selection options and confirmations
- Progress updates, questions, errors, summaries

Technical terms remain in English.

## Workflow

### Progress Checklist

```
Comic Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Setup & Analyze
  - [ ] 1.1 Analyze content
  - [ ] 1.2 Check existing directory
- [ ] Step 2: Confirmation - Style & options ⚠️ REQUIRED
- [ ] Step 3: Generate storyboard + characters
- [ ] Step 4: Review outline (conditional)
- [ ] Step 5: Generate prompts
- [ ] Step 6: Review prompts (conditional)
- [ ] Step 7: Generate images
  - [ ] 7.1 Generate character sheet (if needed) → characters/characters.png
  - [ ] 7.2 Generate pages (with character descriptions embedded in prompt)
- [ ] Step 8: Completion report
```

### Flow

```
Input → Analyze → [Check Existing?] → [Confirm: Style + Reviews] → Storyboard → [Review?] → Prompts → [Review?] → Images → Complete
```

### Step Summary

| Step | Action | Key Output |
|------|--------|------------|
| 1.1 | Analyze content | `analysis.md`, `source-{slug}.md` |
| 1.2 | Check existing directory | Handle conflicts |
| 2 | Confirm style, focus, audience, reviews | User preferences |
| 3 | Generate storyboard + characters | `storyboard.md`, `characters/` |
| 4 | Review outline (if requested) | User approval |
| 5 | Generate prompts | `prompts/*.md` |
| 6 | Review prompts (if requested) | User approval |
| 7.1 | Generate character sheet (if needed) | `characters/characters.png` |
| 7.2 | Generate pages | `*.png` files |
| 8 | Completion report | Summary |

### User Questions

Use the `clarify` tool to confirm options. Since `clarify` handles one question at a time, ask the most important question first and proceed sequentially. See [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md) for the full Step 2 question set.

**Timeout handling (CRITICAL)**: `clarify` can return `"The user did not provide a response within the time limit. Use your best judgement to make the choice and proceed."` — this is NOT user consent to default everything.

- Treat it as a default **for that one question only**. Continue asking the remaining Step 2 questions in sequence; each question is an independent consent point.
- **Surface the default to the user visibly** in your next message so they have a chance to correct it: e.g. `"Style: defaulted to ohmsha preset (clarify timed out). Say the word to switch."` — an unreported default is indistinguishable from never having asked.
- Do NOT collapse Step 2 into a single "use all defaults" pass after one timeout. If the user is genuinely absent, they will be equally absent for all five questions — but they can correct visible defaults when they return, and cannot correct invisible ones.

### Step 7: Image Generation

Use Hermes' built-in `image_generate` tool for all image rendering. Its schema accepts only `prompt` and `aspect_ratio` (`landscape` | `portrait` | `square`); it **returns a URL**, not a local file. Every generated page or character sheet must therefore be downloaded to the output directory.

**Prompt file requirement (hard)**: write each image's full, final prompt to a standalone file under `prompts/` (naming: `NN-{type}-[slug].md`) BEFORE calling `image_generate`. The prompt file is the reproducibility record.

**Aspect ratio mapping** — the storyboard's `aspect_ratio` field maps to `image_generate`'s format as follows:

| Storyboard ratio | `image_generate` format |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| `3:4`, `9:16`, `2:3` | `portrait` |
| `4:3`, `16:9`, `3:2` | `landscape` |
| `1:1` | `square` |

**Download step** — after every `image_generate` call:
1. Read the URL from the tool result
2. Fetch the image bytes using an **absolute** output path, e.g.
   `curl -fsSL "<url>" -o /abs/path/to/comic/<slug>/NN-page-<slug>.png`
3. Verify the file exists and is non-empty at that exact path before proceeding to the next page

**Never rely on shell CWD persistence for `-o` paths.** The terminal tool's persistent-shell CWD can change between batches (session expiry, `TERMINAL_LIFETIME_SECONDS`, a failed `cd` that leaves you in the wrong directory). `curl -o relative/path.png` is a silent footgun: if CWD has drifted, the file lands somewhere else with no error. **Always pass a fully-qualified absolute path to `-o`**, or pass `workdir=<abs path>` to the terminal tool. Incident Apr 2026: pages 06-09 of a 10-page comic landed at the repo root instead of `comic/<slug>/` because batch 3 inherited a stale CWD from batch 2 and `curl -o 06-page-skills.png` wrote to the wrong directory. The agent then spent several turns claiming the files existed where they didn't.

**7.1 Character sheet** — generate it (to `characters/characters.png`, aspect `landscape`) when the comic is multi-page with recurring characters. Skip for simple presets (e.g., four-panel minimalist) or single-page comics. The prompt file at `characters/characters.md` must exist before invoking `image_generate`. The rendered PNG is a **human-facing review artifact** (so the user can visually verify character design) and a reference for later regenerations or manual prompt edits — it does **not** drive Step 7.2. Page prompts are already written in Step 5 from the **text descriptions** in `characters/characters.md`; `image_generate` cannot accept images as visual input.

**7.2 Pages** — each page's prompt MUST already be at `prompts/NN-{cover|page}-[slug].md` before invoking `image_generate`. Because `image_generate` is prompt-only, character consistency is enforced by **embedding character descriptions (sourced from `characters/characters.md`) inline in every page prompt during Step 5**. The embedding is done uniformly whether or not a PNG sheet is produced in 7.1; the PNG is only a review/regeneration aid.

**Backup rule**: existing `prompts/…md` and `…png` files → rename with `-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` suffix before regenerating.

## Page Modification

| Action | Steps |
|--------|-------|
| **Edit** | **Update prompt file FIRST** → regenerate image → download new PNG |
| **Add** | Create prompt at position → generate with character descriptions embedded → renumber subsequent → update storyboard |
| **Delete** | Remove files → renumber subsequent → update storyboard |

**IMPORTANT**: When updating pages, ALWAYS update the prompt file (`prompts/NN-{cover|page}-[slug].md`) FIRST before regenerating. This ensures changes are documented and reproducible.

## Pitfalls

- Image generation: 10-30 seconds per page; auto-retry once on failure
- **Always download** the URL returned by `image_generate` to a local PNG — downstream tooling (and the user's review) expects files in the output directory, not ephemeral URLs
- **Use absolute paths for `curl -o`** — never rely on persistent-shell CWD across batches. Silent footgun: files land in the wrong directory and subsequent `ls` on the intended path shows nothing. See Step 7 "Download step".
- Use stylized alternatives for sensitive public figures
- **Step 2 confirmation required** - do not skip
- **Steps 4/6 conditional** - only if user requested in Step 2
- **Step 7.1 character sheet** - recommended for multi-page comics, optional for simple presets. The PNG is a review/regeneration aid; page prompts (written in Step 5) use the text descriptions in `characters/characters.md`, not the PNG. `image_generate` does not accept images as visual input
- **Strip secrets** — scan source content for API keys, tokens, or credentials before writing any output file

## Keyword Shortcuts

When user input contains these keywords, **auto-select** the associated layout and offer associated styles as top recommendations in Step 3. Skip content-based layout inference for matched keywords.

If a shortcut has **Prompt Notes**, append them to the generated prompt (Step 5) as additional style instructions.

| User Keyword | Layout | Recommended Styles | Default Aspect | Prompt Notes |

## Output Structure

```
infographic/{topic-slug}/
├── source-{slug}.{ext}
├── analysis.md
├── structured-content.md
├── prompts/infographic.md
└── infographic.png
```

Slug: 2-4 words kebab-case from topic. Conflict: append `-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.

## Core Principles

- Preserve source data faithfully — no summarization or rephrasing (but **strip any credentials, API keys, tokens, or secrets** before including in outputs)
- Define learning objectives before structuring content
- Structure for visual communication (headlines, labels, visual elements)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Content

**Load references**: Read `references/analysis-framework.md` from this skill.

1. Save source content (file path or paste → `source.md` using `write_file`)
   - **Backup rule**: If `source.md` exists, rename to `source-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`
2. Analyze: topic, data type, complexity, tone, audience
3. Detect source language and user language
4. Extract design instructions from user input
5. Save analysis to `analysis.md`
   - **Backup rule**: If `analysis.md` exists, rename to `analysis-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`

See `references/analysis-framework.md` for detailed format.

### Step 2: Generate Structured Content → `structured-content.md`

Transform content into infographic structure:
1. Title and learning objectives
2. Sections with: key concept, content (verbatim), visual element, text labels
3. Data points (all statistics/quotes copied exactly)
4. Design instructions from user

**Rules**: Markdown only. No new information. Preserve data faithfully. Strip any credentials or secrets from output.

See `references/structured-content-template.md` for detailed format.

### Step 3: Recommend Combinations

**3.1 Check Keyword Shortcuts first**: If user input matches a keyword from the **Keyword Shortcuts** table, auto-select the associated layout and prioritize associated styles as top recommendations. Skip content-based layout inference.

**3.2 Otherwise**, recommend 3-5 layout×style combinations based on:
- Data structure → matching layout
- Content tone → matching style
- Audience expectations
- User design instructions

### Step 4: Confirm Options

Use the `clarify` tool to confirm options with the user. Since `clarify` handles one question at a time, ask the most important question first:

**Q1 — Combination**: Present 3+ layout×style combos with rationale. Ask user to pick one.

**Q2 — Aspect**: Ask for aspect ratio preference (landscape/portrait/square or custom W:H).

**Q3 — Language** (only if source ≠ user language): Ask which language the text content should use.

### Step 5: Generate Prompt → `prompts/infographic.md`

**Backup rule**: If `prompts/infographic.md` exists, rename to `prompts/infographic-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`

**Load references**: Read the selected layout from `references/layouts/<layout>.md` and style from `references/styles/<style>.md`.

Combine:
1. Layout definition from `references/layouts/<layout>.md`
2. Style definition from `references/styles/<style>.md`
3. Base template from `references/base-prompt.md`
4. Structured content from Step 2
5. All text in confirmed language

**Aspect ratio resolution** for `{{ASPECT_RATIO}}`:
- Named presets → ratio string: landscape→`16:9`, portrait→`9:16`, square→`1:1`
- Custom W:H ratios → use as-is (e.g., `3:4`, `4:3`, `2.35:1`)

Save the assembled prompt to `prompts/infographic.md` using `write_file`.

### Step 6: Generate Image

Use the `image_generate` tool with the assembled prompt from Step 5.

- Map aspect ratio to image_generate's format: `16:9` → `landscape`, `9:16` → `portrait`, `1:1` → `square`
- For custom ratios, pick the closest named aspect
- On failure, auto-retry once
- Save the resulting image URL/path to the output directory

### Step 7: Output Summary

Report: topic, layout, style, aspect, language, output path, files created.

## References

- `references/analysis-framework.md` — Analysis methodology
- `references/structured-content-template.md` — Content format
- `references/base-prompt.md` — Prompt template
- `references/layouts/<layout>.md` — 21 layout definitions
- `references/styles/<style>.md` — 21 style definitions

## Pitfalls

1. **Data integrity is paramount** — never summarize, paraphrase, or alter source statistics. "73% increase" must stay "73% increase", not "significant increase".
2. **Strip secrets** — always scan source content for API keys, tokens, or credentials before including in any output file.
3. **One message per section** — each infographic section should convey one clear concept. Overloading sections reduces readability.
4. **Style consistency** — the style definition from the references file must be applied consistently across the entire infographic. Don't mix styles.
5. **image_generate aspect ratios** — the tool only supports `landscape`, `portrait`, and `square`. Custom ratios like `3:4` should map to the nearest option (portrait in that case).

## Article Illustrator

Adapted from [baoyu-article-illustrator](https://github.com/JimLiu/baoyu-skills) for Hermes Agent's tool ecosystem.

Analyze articles, identify illustration positions, generate images with **Type × Style × Palette** consistency.

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when the user asks to illustrate an article, add images to an article, generate illustrations for content, or uses phrases like "为文章配图", "illustrate article", or "add images". The user provides an article (file path or pasted content) and optionally specifies type, style, palette, or density.

## Three Dimensions

| Dimension | Controls | Examples |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Type** | Information structure | infographic, scene, flowchart, comparison, framework, timeline |
| **Style** | Rendering approach | notion, warm, minimal, blueprint, watercolor, elegant |
| **Palette** | Color scheme (optional) | macaron, warm, neon — overrides style's default colors |

Combine freely: `type=infographic, style=vector-illustration, palette=macaron`.

Or use presets: `edu-visual` → type + style + palette in one shot. See [style-presets.md](references/style-presets.md).

## Types

| Type | Best For |
|------|----------|
| `infographic` | Data, metrics, technical |
| `scene` | Narratives, emotional |
| `flowchart` | Processes, workflows |
| `comparison` | Side-by-side, options |
| `framework` | Models, architecture |
| `timeline` | History, evolution |

## Styles

See [references/styles.md](references/styles.md) for Core Styles, the full gallery, and Type × Style compatibility.

## Output Structure

```
{output-dir}/
├── source-{slug}.{ext}    # Only for pasted content
├── outline.md
├── prompts/
│   └── NN-{type}-{slug}.md
└── NN-{type}-{slug}.png
```

**Default output directory**:

| Input | Output Directory | Markdown Insert Path |
|-------|------------------|----------------------|
| Article file path | `{article-dir}/imgs/` | `imgs/NN-{type}-{slug}.png` |
| Pasted content | `illustrations/{topic-slug}/` (cwd) | `illustrations/{topic-slug}/NN-{type}-{slug}.png` |

If the user asks for a different layout (e.g., images alongside the article, or a `illustrations/` subdirectory), honor that.

**Slug**: 2-4 words, kebab-case. **Conflict**: append `-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.

## Core Principles

- **Visualize concepts, not metaphors** — if the article uses a metaphor (e.g., "电锯切西瓜"), illustrate the underlying concept, not the literal image.
- **Labels use article data** — actual numbers, terms, and quotes from the article, not generic placeholders.
- **Prompt files are reproducibility records** — every illustration must have a saved prompt file under `prompts/` before any image is generated.
- **Strip secrets** — scan source content for API keys, tokens, or credentials before writing anything to disk.

## Workflow

```
- [ ] Step 1: Detect reference images (if provided)
- [ ] Step 2: Analyze content
- [ ] Step 3: Confirm settings (clarify tool, one question at a time)
- [ ] Step 4: Generate outline
- [ ] Step 5: Generate prompts
- [ ] Step 6: Generate images (image_generate)
- [ ] Step 7: Finalize
```

### Step 1: Detect Reference Images

If the user supplies reference images (paths pasted inline, attachments, or a URL):

1. For each reference, call `vision_analyze` with the path/URL and a question asking for style, palette, composition, and subject. Record the returned description in `{output-dir}/references/NN-ref-{slug}.md` via `write_file`.
2. **Do not** try to copy the binary via `write_file` / `read_file` — those are text-only. If you want a local copy for the record, use `terminal` (`cp "$src" "{output-dir}/references/NN-ref-{slug}.{ext}"`). The skill itself never needs to read the binary; it works off the vision description.
3. Since `image_generate` doesn't take image inputs, the vision description is what gets embedded in prompts during Step 5.

Full procedures: [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md#step-1-detect-reference-images).

### Step 2: Analyze

| Analysis | Output |
|----------|--------|
| Content type | Technical / Tutorial / Methodology / Narrative |
| Purpose | information / visualization / imagination |
| Core arguments | 2-5 main points |
| Positions | Where illustrations add value |

Read source (file path → `read_file`, or pasted text) and write the analysis to `{output-dir}/analysis.md` using `write_file`.

Full procedures: [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md#step-2-analyze).

### Step 3: Confirm Settings

Use the `clarify` tool. Since `clarify` handles one question at a time, ask the most important question first. Skip any question whose answer is already present in the user's request.

| Order | Question | Options |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Q1 | **Preset or Type** | [Recommended preset], [alt preset], or manual: infographic, scene, flowchart, comparison, framework, timeline, mixed |
| Q2 | **Density** | minimal (1-2), balanced (3-5), per-section (Recommended), rich (6+) |
| Q3 | **Style** *(skip if preset chosen in Q1)* | [Recommended], minimal-flat, sci-fi, hand-drawn, editorial, scene, poster |
| Q4 | **Palette** *(optional)* | Default (style colors), macaron, warm, neon |
| Q5 | **Language** *(only if article language is ambiguous)* | article language / user language |

Don't ask more than 2-3 `clarify` questions in a row. If the user already specified these in their request, skip entirely.

Full procedures: [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md#step-3-confirm-settings).

### Step 4: Generate Outline → `outline.md`

Save `{output-dir}/outline.md` using `write_file` with frontmatter (type, density, style, palette, image_count) and one entry per illustration:

```yaml
## Illustration 1
**Position**: [section/paragraph]
**Purpose**: [why]
**Visual Content**: [what to show]
**Filename**: 01-infographic-concept-name.png
```

Full template: [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md#step-4-generate-outline).

### Step 5: Generate Prompts

**BLOCKING**: Every illustration must have a saved prompt file before any image is generated — the prompt file is the reproducibility record.

For each illustration:

1. Create a prompt file per [references/prompt-construction.md](references/prompt-construction.md).
2. Save to `{output-dir}/prompts/NN-{type}-{slug}.md` using `write_file` with YAML frontmatter.
3. Prompts MUST use type-specific templates with structured sections (ZONES / LABELS / COLORS / STYLE / ASPECT).
4. LABELS MUST include article-specific data: actual numbers, terms, metrics, quotes.
5. Process references (`direct`/`style`/`palette`) per prompt frontmatter — for `direct` usage, embed a textual description of the reference in the prompt (since `image_generate` doesn't take reference-image inputs).

### Step 6: Generate Images

For each prompt file:

1. Call `image_generate(prompt=..., aspect_ratio=...)`. `image_generate` returns a JSON result containing an image URL; it does NOT write to disk and does NOT accept an output path.
2. Map the prompt's `ASPECT` to `image_generate`'s enum: `16:9` → `landscape`, `9:16` → `portrait`, `1:1` → `square`. Custom ratios → nearest named aspect.
3. Download the returned URL to `{output-dir}/NN-{type}-{slug}.png` via `terminal` (e.g. `curl -sSL -o "{output-dir}/NN-{type}-{slug}.png" "{url}"`).
4. On generation failure, auto-retry once.

Note: the underlying image-generation backend is user-configured (default: FAL FLUX 2 Klein 9B) and is NOT agent-selectable via `image_generate`. Do not write model names into prompts expecting them to route.

### Step 7: Finalize

Insert `![description]({relative-path}/NN-{type}-{slug}.png)` after the corresponding paragraph. Alt text: concise description in the article's language.

Report:

```
Article Illustration Complete!
Article: [path] | Type: [type] | Density: [level] | Style: [style] | Palette: [palette or default]
Images: X/N generated
```

## Modification

## Pitfalls

1. **Data integrity is paramount** — never summarize, paraphrase, or alter source statistics. "73% increase" stays "73% increase".
2. **Strip secrets** — scan source content for API keys, tokens, or credentials before including in any output file.
3. **Don't illustrate metaphors literally** — visualize the underlying concept.
4. **Prompt files are mandatory** — no image generation without a saved prompt file. The file is what lets you regenerate or switch backends later.
5. **`image_generate` aspect ratios** — the tool supports `landscape`, `portrait`, and `square`. Custom ratios map to the nearest option.
6. **`image_generate` returns a URL, not a local file** — always download via `terminal` (`curl`) before inserting local image paths into the article.
7. **No backend selection from the agent** — `image_generate` uses whatever model the user configured (default: FAL FLUX 2 Klein 9B). Don't write `"use <model> to generate this"` into prompts expecting it to route.

## Knowledge Comic Creator

Adapted from [baoyu-comic](https://github.com/JimLiu/baoyu-skills) for Hermes Agent's tool ecosystem.

Create original knowledge comics with flexible art style × tone combinations.

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when the user asks to create a knowledge/educational comic, biography comic, tutorial comic, or uses terms like "知识漫画", "教育漫画", or "Logicomix-style". The user provides content (text, file path, URL, or topic) and optionally specifies art style, tone, layout, aspect ratio, or language.

## Reference Images

Hermes' `image_generate` tool is **prompt-only** — it accepts a text prompt and an aspect ratio, and returns an image URL. It does **NOT** accept reference images. When the user supplies a reference image, use it to **extract traits in text** that get embedded in every page prompt:

**Intake**: Accept file paths when the user provides them (or pastes images in conversation).
- File path(s) → copy to `refs/NN-ref-{slug}.{ext}` alongside the comic output for provenance
- Pasted image with no path → ask the user for the path via `clarify`, or extract style traits verbally as a text fallback
- No reference → skip this section

**Usage modes** (per reference):

| Usage | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `style` | Extract style traits (line treatment, texture, mood) and append to every page's prompt body |
| `palette` | Extract hex colors and append to every page's prompt body |
| `scene` | Extract scene composition or subject notes and append to the relevant page(s) |

**Record in each page's prompt frontmatter** when refs exist:

```yaml
references:
  - ref_id: 01
    filename: 01-ref-scene.png
    usage: style
    traits: "muted earth tones, soft-edged ink wash, low-contrast backgrounds"
```

Character consistency is driven by **text descriptions** in `characters/characters.md` (written in Step 3) that get embedded inline in every page prompt (Step 5). The optional PNG character sheet generated in Step 7.1 is a human-facing review artifact, not an input to `image_generate`.

## Options

### Visual Dimensions

| Option | Values | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Art | ligne-claire (default), manga, realistic, ink-brush, chalk, minimalist | Art style / rendering technique |

## File Structure

Output directory: `comic/{topic-slug}/`
- Slug: 2-4 words kebab-case from topic (e.g., `alan-turing-bio`)
- Conflict: append timestamp (e.g., `turing-story-20260118-143052`)

**Contents**:
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `source-{slug}.md` | Saved source content (kebab-case slug matches the output directory) |
| `analysis.md` | Content analysis |
| `storyboard.md` | Storyboard with panel breakdown |
| `characters/characters.md` | Character definitions |
| `characters/characters.png` | Character reference sheet (downloaded from `image_generate`) |
| `prompts/NN-{cover\|page}-[slug].md` | Generation prompts |
| `NN-{cover\|page}-[slug].png` | Generated images (downloaded from `image_generate`) |
| `refs/NN-ref-{slug}.{ext}` | User-supplied reference images (optional, for provenance) |

## Language Handling

**Detection Priority**:
1. User-specified language (explicit option)
2. User's conversation language
3. Source content language

**Rule**: Use user's input language for ALL interactions:
- Storyboard outlines and scene descriptions
- Image generation prompts
- User selection options and confirmations
- Progress updates, questions, errors, summaries

Technical terms remain in English.

## Workflow

```

### Flow

```
Input → Analyze → [Check Existing?] → [Confirm: Style + Reviews] → Storyboard → [Review?] → Prompts → [Review?] → Images → Complete
```

### Step Summary

| Step | Action | Key Output |
|------|--------|------------|
| 1.1 | Analyze content | `analysis.md`, `source-{slug}.md` |
| 1.2 | Check existing directory | Handle conflicts |
| 2 | Confirm style, focus, audience, reviews | User preferences |
| 3 | Generate storyboard + characters | `storyboard.md`, `characters/` |
| 4 | Review outline (if requested) | User approval |

| 7.1 | Generate character sheet (if needed) | `characters/characters.png` |
| 7.2 | Generate pages | `*.png` files |
| 8 | Completion report | Summary |

### User Questions

Use the `clarify` tool to confirm options. Since `clarify` handles one question at a time, ask the most important question first and proceed sequentially. See [references/workflow.md](references/workflow.md) for the full Step 2 question set.

**Timeout handling (CRITICAL)**: `clarify` can return `"The user did not provide a response within the time limit. Use your best judgement to make the choice and proceed."` — this is NOT user consent to default everything.

- Treat it as a default **for that one question only**. Continue asking the remaining Step 2 questions in sequence; each question is an independent consent point.
- **Surface the default to the user visibly** in your next message so they have a chance to correct it: e.g. `"Style: defaulted to ohmsha preset (clarify timed out). Say the word to switch."` — an unreported default is indistinguishable from never having asked.
- Do NOT collapse Step 2 into a single "use all defaults" pass after one timeout. If the user is genuinely absent, they will be equally absent for all five questions — but they can correct visible defaults when they return, and cannot correct invisible ones.

### Step 7: Image Generation

Use Hermes' built-in `image_generate` tool for all image rendering. Its schema accepts only `prompt` and `aspect_ratio` (`landscape` | `portrait` | `square`); it **returns a URL**, not a local file. Every generated page or character sheet must therefore be downloaded to the output directory.

**Prompt file requirement (hard)**: write each image's full, final prompt to a standalone file under `prompts/` (naming: `NN-{type}-[slug].md`) BEFORE calling `image_generate`. The prompt file is the reproducibility record.

**Aspect ratio mapping** — the storyboard's `aspect_ratio` field maps to `image_generate`'s format as follows:

| Storyboard ratio | `image_generate` format |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| `3:4`, `9:16`, `2:3` | `portrait` |
| `4:3`, `16:9`, `3:2` | `landscape` |
| `1:1` | `square` |

**Download step** — after every `image_generate` call:
1. Read the URL from the tool result
2. Fetch the image bytes using an **absolute** output path, e.g.
   `curl -fsSL "<url>" -o /abs/path/to/comic/<slug>/NN-page-<slug>.png`
3. Verify the file exists and is non-empty at that exact path before proceeding to the next page

**Never rely on shell CWD persistence for `-o` paths.** The terminal tool's persistent-shell CWD can change between batches (session expiry, `TERMINAL_LIFETIME_SECONDS`, a failed `cd` that leaves you in the wrong directory). `curl -o relative/path.png` is a silent footgun: if CWD has drifted, the file lands somewhere else with no error. **Always pass a fully-qualified absolute path to `-o`**, or pass `workdir=<abs path>` to the terminal tool. Incident Apr 2026: pages 06-09 of a 10-page comic landed at the repo root instead of `comic/<slug>/` because batch 3 inherited a stale CWD from batch 2 and `curl -o 06-page-skills.png` wrote to the wrong directory. The agent then spent several turns claiming the files existed where they didn't.

**7.1 Character sheet** — generate it (to `characters/characters.png`, aspect `landscape`) when the comic is multi-page with recurring characters. Skip for simple presets (e.g., four-panel minimalist) or single-page comics. The prompt file at `characters/characters.md` must exist before invoking `image_generate`. The rendered PNG is a **human-facing review artifact** (so the user can visually verify character design) and a reference for later regenerations or manual prompt edits — it does **not** drive Step 7.2. Page prompts are already written in Step 5 from the **text descriptions** in `characters/characters.md`; `image_generate` cannot accept images as visual input.

**7.2 Pages** — each page's prompt MUST already be at `prompts/NN-{cover|page}-[slug].md` before invoking `image_generate`. Because `image_generate` is prompt-only, character consistency is enforced by **embedding character descriptions (sourced from `characters/characters.md`) inline in every page prompt during Step 5**. The embedding is done uniformly whether or not a PNG sheet is produced in 7.1; the PNG is only a review/regeneration aid.

**Backup rule**: existing `prompts/…md` and `…png` files → rename with `-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` suffix before regenerating.

## Page Modification

| Action | Steps |
|--------|-------|
| **Edit** | **Update prompt file FIRST** → regenerate image → download new PNG |
| **Add** | Create prompt at position → generate with character descriptions embedded → renumber subsequent → update storyboard |
| **Delete** | Remove files → renumber subsequent → update storyboard |

**IMPORTANT**: When updating pages, ALWAYS update the prompt file (`prompts/NN-{cover|page}-[slug].md`) FIRST before regenerating. This ensures changes are documented and reproducible.

## Pitfalls

- Image generation: 10-30 seconds per page; auto-retry once on failure
- **Always download** the URL returned by `image_generate` to a local PNG — downstream tooling (and the user's review) expects files in the output directory, not ephemeral URLs
- **Use absolute paths for `curl -o`** — never rely on persistent-shell CWD across batches. Silent footgun: files land in the wrong directory and subsequent `ls` on the intended path shows nothing. See Step 7 "Download step".
- Use stylized alternatives for sensitive public figures
- **Step 2 confirmation required** - do not skip
- **Steps 4/6 conditional** - only if user requested in Step 2
- **Step 7.1 character sheet** - recommended for multi-page comics, optional for simple presets. The PNG is a review/regeneration aid; page prompts (written in Step 5) use the text descriptions in `characters/characters.md`, not the PNG. `image_generate` does not accept images as visual input
- **Strip secrets** — scan source content for API keys, tokens, or credentials before writing any output file

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when the user asks to create an infographic, visual summary, information graphic, or uses terms like "信息图", "可视化", or "高密度信息大图". The user provides content (text, file path, URL, or topic) and optionally specifies layout, style, aspect ratio, or language.

## Options

## Keyword Shortcuts

When user input contains these keywords, **auto-select** the associated layout and offer associated styles as top recommendations in Step 3. Skip content-based layout inference for matched keywords.

If a shortcut has **Prompt Notes**, append them to the generated prompt (Step 5) as additional style instructions.

| User Keyword | Layout | Recommended Styles | Default Aspect | Prompt Notes |
|--------------|--------|--------------------|----------------|--------------|
| 高密度信息大图 / high-density-info | `dense-modules` | `morandi-journal`, `pop-laboratory`, `retro-pop-grid` | portrait | — |
| 信息图 / infographic | `bento-grid` | `craft-handmade` | landscape | Minimalist: clean canvas, ample whitespace, no complex background textures. Simple cartoon elements and icons only. |

## Output Structure

```
infographic/{topic-slug}/
├── source-{slug}.{ext}
├── analysis.md
├── structured-content.md
├── prompts/infographic.md
└── infographic.png
```

Slug: 2-4 words kebab-case from topic. Conflict: append `-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.

## Core Principles

- Preserve source data faithfully — no summarization or rephrasing (but **strip any credentials, API keys, tokens, or secrets** before including in outputs)
- Define learning objectives before structuring content
- Structure for visual communication (headlines, labels, visual elements)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Content

**Load references**: Read `references/analysis-framework.md` from this skill.

1. Save source content (file path or paste → `source.md` using `write_file`)
   - **Backup rule**: If `source.md` exists, rename to `source-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`
2. Analyze: topic, data type, complexity, tone, audience
3. Detect source language and user language
4. Extract design instructions from user input
5. Save analysis to `analysis.md`
   - **Backup rule**: If `analysis.md` exists, rename to `analysis-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`

See `references/analysis-framework.md` for detailed format.

### Step 2: Generate Structured Content → `structured-content.md`

Transform content into infographic structure:
1. Title and learning objectives
2. Sections with: key concept, content (verbatim), visual element, text labels
3. Data points (all statistics/quotes copied exactly)
4. Design instructions from user

**Rules**: Markdown only. No new information. Preserve data faithfully. Strip any credentials or secrets from output.

See `references/structured-content-template.md` for detailed format.

### Step 3: Recommend Combinations

**3.1 Check Keyword Shortcuts first**: If user input matches a keyword from the **Keyword Shortcuts** table, auto-select the associated layout and prioritize associated styles as top recommendations. Skip content-based layout inference.

**3.2 Otherwise**, recommend 3-5 layout×style combinations based on:
- Data structure → matching layout
- Content tone → matching style
- Audience expectations
- User design instructions

### Step 4: Confirm Options

Use the `clarify` tool to confirm options with the user. Since `clarify` handles one question at a time, ask the most important question first:

**Q1 — Combination**: Present 3+ layout×style combos with rationale. Ask user to pick one.

**Q2 — Aspect**: Ask for aspect ratio preference (landscape/portrait/square or custom W:H).

**Q3 — Language** (only if source ≠ user language): Ask which language the text content should use.

### Step 5: Generate Prompt → `prompts/infographic.md`

**Backup rule**: If `prompts/infographic.md` exists, rename to `prompts/infographic-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`

**Load references**: Read the selected layout from `references/layouts/<layout>.md` and style from `references/styles/<style>.md`.

Combine:
1. Layout definition from `references/layouts/<layout>.md`
2. Style definition from `references/styles/<style>.md`
3. Base template from `references/base-prompt.md`
4. Structured content from Step 2
5. All text in confirmed language

**Aspect ratio resolution** for `{{ASPECT_RATIO}}`:
- Named presets → ratio string: landscape→`16:9`, portrait→`9:16`, square→`1:1`
- Custom W:H ratios → use as-is (e.g., `3:4`, `4:3`, `2.35:1`)

Save the assembled prompt to `prompts/infographic.md` using `write_file`.

### Step 6: Generate Image

Use the `image_generate` tool with the assembled prompt from Step 5.

- Map aspect ratio to image_generate's format: `16:9` → `landscape`, `9:16` → `portrait`, `1:1` → `square`
- For custom ratios, pick the closest named aspect
- On failure, auto-retry once
- Save the resulting image URL/path to the output directory

### Step 7: Output Summary

Report: topic, layout, style, aspect, language, output path, files created.

- `references/base-prompt.md` — Prompt template
- `references/layouts/<layout>.md` — 21 layout definitions
- `references/styles/<style>.md` — 21 style definitions

## Pitfalls

1. **Data integrity is paramount** — never summarize, paraphrase, or alter source statistics. "73% increase" must stay "73% increase", not "significant increase".
2. **Strip secrets** — always scan source content for API keys, tokens, or credentials before including in any output file.
3. **One message per section** — each infographic section should convey one clear concept. Overloading sections reduces readability.
4. **Style consistency** — the style definition from the references file must be applied consistently across the entire infographic. Don't mix styles.
5. **image_generate aspect ratios** — the tool only supports `landscape`, `portrait`, and `square`. Custom ratios like `3:4` should map to the nearest option (portrait in that case).
